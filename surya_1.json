The unique nature of concurrent health, demand and supply shocks due to the pandemic and the consequent lockdowns to contain its spread, meant that the government had no option but to increase spending in healthcare and social protection, even if it increased fiscal deficit sharply.", "That said, this critical juncture is also an opportune moment to not only craft a short-term response to deal with the effect of Covid-19 on lives, livelihoods and the economy, but also to overhaul the existing inefficient systems and rectify long-running economic ills that are holding back inclusive economic growth and prosperity. Unfortunately, the budget loses sight of this opportunity at this critical juncture. Similarly, the budget is not clear about the medium-term strategy for economic recovery, growth-enhancing revenue policy and a consolidation plan to narrow the widening fiscal deficit.", "The federal government\u2019s total budget for the next fiscal year is Rs1.47 trillion, which is lower than the Rs1.53 trillion budget estimate for 2019-20, but 37.4 percent higher than the revised estimate. It comprises Rs948.9 billion as recurrent expenditures (64.4 percent of the total outlay), Rs352.9 billion as capital expenditures, and Rs172.8 billion as a financial provision. Note that fiscal transfers and conditional grants to subnational governments are also included in recurrent spending of the federal government. So, the capital spending allocation of all tiers of government is a bit higher than the one indicated in the centre\u2019s budget.", "Total central receipts (revenue and foreign grants) are expected to cover 65 percent of the budget. The government is planning to cover the budget gap by borrowing internally and externally. The fiscal deficit is expected to increase to about 8 percent of the gross domestic product.", "The budget also includes a Covid-19 economic recovery package, but it is not really an additional fiscal package that is going to prop up subdued demand and business activities. Nor is it likely to restore the severely disrupted supply networks and output. Most of the already announced incentives and initiatives are subsumed in the budget, including a Rs100 billion refinancing facility by the central bank. The government is planning to set up a separate Rs50 billion fund to provide subsidised loans, at 5 percent interest, to sectors badly affected by the Covid-19. The government has not committed a full amount to the fund as it expects contributions from public enterprises and development partners. The operationalisation and effectiveness of this fund is uncertain, as there is no standard operating procedure that outlines eligibility and bureaucratic prerequisites.", "Furthermore, the government argues that there is about NRs 60 billion worth of interest and utility subsidies, and tax concessions. There is also a plan to employ 700,000 people through direct employment, and provide training related to skills upgradation and technical education.", "Besides these mundane, halfhearted measures to deal with the immediate effect of the crisis, the government had an opportunity to overhaul long-running economic ills and rigid systems that have fostered extractive economic and political institutions. It is easier to do when an economy reaches a critical juncture, which according to economists Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson are \u2018major events that disrupt the existing political and economic balance\u2019. In their book ", ", they argue that at critical junctures a country can transform its extractive political and economic institutions into inclusive ones, resulting in meaningful socioeconomic changes and acceleration on the path to prosperity. Nepal reached this kind of critical juncture in the 1950s (end of Rana rule), 1990s (restoration of democracy), 2006 (end of Maoist insurgency and monarchy) and 2015 (catastrophic earthquakes). Unfortunately, we have missed opportunities to reorient economic and political institutions during these times for greater good. Instead, we have let the prevailing political-business nexus to capture land, labour, capital and product markets.", "At the critical juncture created by the pandemic, we are once again missing a chance to roll out transformative reforms to create inclusive political and economic institutions. These include agricultural transformation; consolidation of social protection schemes with a unified digital registry of all beneficiaries (including the Prime Minister Employment Programme and cash allowances); rationalisation of ballooning recurrent spending; freeing markets from the clutches of cartels; changing revenue policy to support growth and innovation; nixing politically-oriented distributive spending; harmonising planning and financial reporting standards across all tiers of governments; prioritising projects strictly based on implementation readiness; sound governance framework to curb misappropriation of public funds, and, lastly, changes to legal, policy and institutional frameworks to increase private sector participation.", "Most of these are transformative in nature and growth-enhancing structural changes that are relatively easy to roll out during critical junctures. They set in motion a process of creative destruction and creative creation processes, which are vital for enhancing private investment, innovation, and public services delivery. They also boost the entrepreneurial spirit and incentivise saving, investment and innovation.", "Besides this missed opportunity, there are three particular macroeconomic takeaways. First, there is no medium-term recovery plan for a sustained recovery. The focus is on immediate-term only with increased funding for the healthcare sector and state-led employment creation. Propping up demand (through additional cash transfers, subsidy and income tax concessions) and maintaining supplies of essential goods and services (including through graded easing of the lockdown), even during the immediate-term, are pretty much ignored. A medium-term recovery strategy could at least include assistance for preventing layoffs in both organised and unorganised sectors, and saving struggling micro, small and medium enterprises from collapsing. The private sector has been largely left to fend the crisis for themselves.", "Second, with declining revenue and increasing spending needs, the fiscal deficit is expected to be around 8 percent of GDP. Besides some discretionary spending\u2014such as insurance cover for frontline staff and social security fund payments\u2014other increased recurrent spending may not be easy to rollback. It will keep recurrent spending at a high level even after the crisis subsides. With consistently lower than expected revenue mobilisation since 2017-18 and an increase in recurrent spending, narrowing down the widening fiscal deficit will require a credible medium-term fiscal consolidation plan. A drastic increase in domestic borrowing to fund the deficit will likely squeeze liquidity and raise interest rates, thus crowding-out private investment. ", "Third, revenue and foreign aid budget estimates and growth targets are too ambitious. For instance, given the past trend, tinkering import duties alone will not be helpful to achieve revenue mobilisation target of 22 percent. Likewise, foreign grant and loans targets are 89 percent and 147 percent respectively\u2014higher than the revised estimate for 2019-20. Note that even after the 2015 earthquakes, the government was able to mobilise less than 50 percent of foreign grants and loans estimated during the budget speech. Similarly, even with a favourable base effect, a GDP growth target of 7 percent is unrealistic, particularly given the prospect of a continued slowdown in agriculture (thanks to a shortage of chemical fertilisers and workers), subdued industrial activities (especially manufacturing and construction), and uncertainty over the recovery of services\u2014especially in travel and tourism, wholesale and retail trade, transportation, real estate, and education.", "***", "."], "author": "Chandan Sapkota", "article_published_date": "", "article_updated_date": "Updated at : June 3, 2020 08:09 "},

In my view, the recent trends of inter-caste solidarity to oppose caste oppression and interracial solidarity to oppose racial oppression as seen in the post-Floyd and post-Navaraj protests is one of the signs of hope for a better future. But Dalits and those who find solidarity with Dalits have to fight on three levels: ideology, structure and practices. This is because caste is deeply ingrained in each of these three forms.

They work harder and longer than men, whether it is in the cultivation of cereals, cash crops and vegetables or poultry farming, livestock raising and management, and forest conservation and management, among others. Their work and contributions tend to be invisible to policymakers and even academics. This is due to the fact that women\u2019s work is not considered as work in national income accounts and in population and agricultural censuses.

This invisibility has deprived women farmers their rightful access to productive agricultural inputs and services. Despite purported gender mainstreaming in agriculture, their needs and constraints have tended to be pushed to the back burner as the general retort is 'they have been mainstreamed'.", "Lack of comprehensive understanding of the concept of gender mainstreaming in agriculture has engendered the misconception that there is no need for separate women-targeted agricultural programmes, adding to the woes of women farmers. Female and male farmers have different needs and constraints. Female farmers, unlike male farmers, are burdened by their triple duties as dictated by societal gender norms. Moreover, female farmers are not provided with a level playing field. Agricultural policy still tends to be male-oriented and has not yet fully acknowledged the uneven playing field for female farmers.

While irrigation law has mandated 33 percent reservation for women in the Water Users Association, it has skirted the issue of their legal right to access irrigation water in the absence of land ownership. Women put in more hours than men in irrigation water management, but they have little or no effective access to irrigation water or management.

That '10 percent of GDP' includes all the liquidity enhancements announced over the previous three months by the Reserve Bank of India. Worse, most of these funds remain unused, because commercial banks have been unwilling to lend them on to private-sector firms.", "The banking sector\u2019s stance is understandable. It has been obvious for years that India\u2019s economy suffers from deficient demand, which is why it was in a prolonged slowdown before the pandemic arrived.

But his actions are less likely to constructively contribute to a resolution of the disputes and serve the national interest in the long run.", "It cannot be mere coincidence that two days before Singh inaugurated the road, an international rating agency, Moody\u2019s Investors Service, had ", " India's economic growth prospects for 2020 to a figure close to zero, from its one-month-old estimate of 2.5 percent. For the governments on both sides of the border, the controversy has served for them to divert the attention of the people, media and intelligentsia away from their comparable but blatant failure to take effective steps to contain the spread of the virus and adequately undertake measures to revive economic activities by smoothly ending the prolonged lockdown. ", "In both countries, millions have lost their jobs and livelihoods. Millions of enterprises, particularly small businesses, are on the verge of going bust. There is an impending danger of the masses that are clustered right above the poverty line falling back into the absolute poverty trap. A mass exodus of migrant workers from the cities to the villages without health checks, transportation facilities and food only exposed the poor governance. Acutely inadequate health services are already overwhelmed by the flow of Covid-19 patients. Poorly managed so-called quarantine centres are proving to be new epicentres for mass transmission. Bringing back millions of migrant workers languishing due to Covid-19-induced layoffs in the Gulf countries, Malaysia and other places pose a common challenge for governments in both countries.", "Extremely poor awareness among the masses about both hand and respiratory hygiene that is considered key to containing the spread of the coronavirus is presenting a new danger to add to virus transmission at the community level. The mass media that is instrumental in both correcting government inefficiencies at every level and helping raise awareness among the masses is largely dancing to the tune of the ruler's nationalistic eulogy.", "The Indian media is incessantly harping on about the completely unfounded idea of 'China's hand in Nepal's bid to publish a new map' while the Nepali media generally seems to have fallen prey to Oli's essentially unnecessary tantrums of amending the constitution and altering the 'coat of arms' of Nepal. The reality is that the map and the territorial claim can be established only after the borderline is resolved once and for all through due diplomatic process and agreement. In the virtual jungle of rabble-rousing rants, there is no space left for sane voices that want to dwell on nuanced, result-oriented and dialogue-led diplomacy.", "The maps published by both sides incorporating the disputed territory can establish, once again, nothing more than the fact that it is disputed territory. They certainly serve as the basis for a bargain though. Also, border disputes between any neighbouring countries are commonplace phenomena everywhere. It is equally sensitive too. Therefore, there is no alternative to meaningful dialogue to resolve this issue on the basis of historical facts, treaties, evidences and existing ground realities. The concerned parties, at the same time, should be cautious that the entire agenda is not hijacked by callous and misinformed public opinion which in the process leaves no room for flexibility for official negotiators.", "There are already signs of optimism as both sides have officially kept the doors for constructive dialogue open in their 'official' statements. That is exactly the way to go about. There are historical precedents in the region as well. Five years ago, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, immediately after riding to power during his first tenure, constructively helped to resolve a complex ", " that involved the transfer of 162 enclaves.

The contraction in global output and income on the one hand, and likely persistent scars in the vulnerable economies of South Asia on the other, could trigger a new variety of instability, disharmony and dislocation. The International Monetary Fund has estimated a $9 trillion global loss. And depending upon the duration and intensity of this pandemic, the debilitating consequences provide South Asian countries with no other option than to come to a common platform again.", "With the basic premise of no trade-off between life and livelihood, sharp erosion in remittance from abroad, shrinking export base, the compulsion of keeping imports intact, unprecedented revenue loss and huge hike in domestic and international debt, all eight South Asian countries will suffer from a variety of downward matrices. The pre-Covid-19 regional growth rates that were projected to be between 6-7 percent during 2020-21 are likely to be negative, and in some cases, deeply negative. The esoteric debate about whether the recovery will be instant after this fiscal year (V-shaped) or stagger for a few more years (U-shaped) or even witness a long outbreak and a prolonged economic impact (L-shaped) is absurd at this stage. The redeployment of already limited resources to the health sector would severely limit the flexibility of development expenditure allocations.", "The first major crisis will be that of foreign exchange, with a cascading paralysing impact across sectors and economic activities. As against India\u2019s $485 billion, other SAARC countries Afghanistan ($7.8 billion), Bangladesh ($32.9 billion), Bhutan ($0.98 billion), Maldives ($0.72 billion), Nepal ($8.67 billion), Pakistan ($12.13 billion) and Sri Lanka ($7.5 billion) have relatively very low foreign exchange reserves. The effective stress could be beyond the purview of normal monetary management as remittance from abroad is likely to record the sharpest fall by over 22 percent to $109 billion as estimated by the World Bank.", "In 2019, remittances to South Asia varied from Afghanistan's $0.9 billion to Nepal\u2019s $8.1 billion and India\u2019s $83 billion, Nepal\u2019s southern neighbour being the world\u2019s largest recipient. In India's case, this constituted hardly 2.8 percent of its gross domestic product as against Nepal\u2019s 27.3 percent, Pakistan\u2019s 7.9 percent, Sri Lanka\u2019s 7.8 percent and Bangladesh\u2019s 5.8 percent. This deceleration will hit Nepal the hardest as it has been the crucial financing lifeline for many vulnerable households. ", "Under such a dreadfully contractionary situation, the orthodox option of devaluation to enhance exports and cut down imports and even market-led depreciation in their currencies can hardly be used. The International Monetary Fund states that 'they will need to stabilise their macro economies through new IMF programmes, negotiate a delay in debt payments to bilateral and multilateral lenders, higher taxes and better revenue administration'. Though resorting to international borrowing is an attractive option, most of the South Asian countries are already within a narrow debt trap. For instance, India\u2019s long-term external debt stocks of $411.68 billion is already incomparably higher than Pakistan\u2019s $75.37 billion, Bangladesh ($41.55), Bhutan ($2.5), Nepal ($5.07) and Sri Lanka ($42.9). Most of their external debt stocks to exports ratios are pretty unsustainable with Bhutan\u2019s as high as 313 percent and Pakistan\u2019s 295 percent as against 93 percent for India. More precariously, the debt service to exports ratio is 36 percent for Sri Lanka as against India\u2019s 11 percent. ", "The internal borrowing situations in some of these countries are dangerously hung between an already prevailing massive debt servicing and a burdensome entry into a more suffocating borrowing trap and insurmountable fiscal crevice. Just two months of lockdown has forced India to amend its once much-touted Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act 2003 which primarily aimed at limiting the fiscal deficit to 3 percent of GDP by March 2021. Aimed at disciplining borrowing by hungry states, this provision has been used as a major criterion for the centre-state devolution of resources by the Finance Commission. This was before the crippling impact of a raging pandemic.", "Under the amended Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act, the borrowing limit of each state will be raised from 3 to 5 percent of GDP. However, in this plus 2 percent scenario, except the first 0.5 percent unconditional increase, the other four tranches of 0.25 percent are subjected to difficult conditions including", " Card, urban local body revenues, power distribution and ease of doing business reforms. This is indicative of a desperately intricate scenario ahead. ", "The three least developed economies of Bhutan, Maldives and Nepal could face an excruciating foreign exchange crunch. The historic pegging of Bhutanese and Nepali currencies with the Indian rupee has injected constant stability, and more crucially, protected both the ngultrum and the Nepali rupee from a wayward domestic economy and market-based depreciation. If it was a floating regime, Nepal would have witnessed a harrowingly unprecedented financial crisis during the dismal decade of the Maoist movement. A protracted trade deficit with a limited export base, dismal show in the tourism sector and necessity to keep the import quantum intact will further make Nepal extraordinarily vulnerable.", "A large-scale return of migrants leading to a huge \u2018reserve army\u2019 (as Karl Marx called it) of workers and the compulsion of ensuring a minimum level of food and livelihood security could inspire so far invisibly destabilising rent-seekers, like hoarders, profiteers and fly-by-night operators, to blatantly come overground. It is, therefore, essential for Nepal to cool down in its neighbourly relations and be sagacious in diplomatic manoeuvrings, particularly when neighbourhoods are also painfully engaged in flattening the spread curve. ", "This is where some of the beneficial instruments of SAARC such as food security, currency swapping and power trading need to be effectively utilised by all the member countries. Experiencing initial yet powerful turbulence and other risks, the Sri Lankan president has sought a special $1.1 billion currency swap facility from India to bring some ease in its already draining foreign exchange reserves. This is in addition to the $400 million it has already sought under the SAARC framework of 2012. Over the last three decades, particularly during the ethnic conflict, the Sri Lankan currency so acutely depreciated that, at one point of time, it was seriously considering a Nepal-Bhutan type pegging with the Indian currency.

The team returned in January 1970. ", "Nepal and India have a special relationship. The political relationship has its ups and downs. Two observations are clearly visible. The first is the admirable and favourable relationship that both countries cherish after a major political altercation and the interests of India, the political parties and the government congregate. The 1990 restoration of democracy with an official blockade by India, king Gyanendra\u2019s takeover to deal with the Maoist menace and the 12-point agreement that took place in Delhi followed by the peace process to bring the Maoists into the democratic framework, are examples of three political shifts in recent history that have elevated the relationship. The relationship soured and reached a low when India articulated its reservation over the 2015 Constitution with an unofficial blockade and again with the current question of border encroachment. ", "The second is the rise of China\u2019s influence leading to geopolitical and geo-economic stimulus in the South Asian region. The militarisation of the Himalayan region can be an example of China\u2019s interests being more political in defending the province of Xinjiang, Tibet and Yunnan. China may not be concerned about Maoism and communism nowadays, but it thinks more about Tibet to gesture to India that it too can offer the expenditure on a long-term assurance policy. Nepal needs to balance its foreign policy with changing realignments, as geopolitical strategic trends in South Asia are not what they used to be. South Asia is proceeding towards newer alignments. The current geopolitical realities will have a direct impact on maintaining political trust in border management with immediate neighbours.", "The geopolitical and geo-economic environment of South Asia post-Covid-19 must be well analysed and evaluated for future action considering that Sino-US and Sino-Indo relations are not the same as before. The northern border with China along the Himalaya will continue to be of concern to both China and India. Here, the traditional mechanism of foreign policy management may not prevail. Irrational moves may put the Non-Alignment Movement and the Bangladesh, Bhutan, India and Nepal Motor Vehicles Agreement on life supports, much like the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation.", "Three things must be done by taking India and China on board for immediate and long-term border management.

But we should be able to ignore that particular blip since it had the wholly fortunate result of getting rid of the monarchy itself.

But they made their first impressive presence\u2014as people\u2019s representatives. One mass meeting, supplemented with cultural performances, was capable of turning a whole village into communist sympathisers.", "In the very early years of democratic restoration, however, communists were misconceived. Still remembered vividly for their Jhapa Naxalite movement, for lynching feudal landlords, there were many who feared them. ", "But in the many rural villages of Nepal, many leftist cultural workers had mingled with people so well that even in night vigils after puja, people sang and danced to revolutionary songs. Local communist literature or works that had been translated into Nepali from other languages made for popular reading. The popularity of the firebrand communist leader Madan Bhandari was soaring: on social gatherings, villagers played loud the recordings of the communist general secretary\u2019s speeches.", "New leadership emerged after Bhandari\u2019s tragic, mysterious death in a car accident in his heyday. Meanwhile, for the Congress-led government, two-and-a-half years had made the party of prime minister Girija Prasad Koirala greatly unpopular. This turned the tide in favour of the Unified Marxists Leninists.", "The revered communist leader Manmohan Adhikari then became the prime minister. To counter popular misgivings, he introduced old-age allowances and implemented the immensely popular \u2018develop your own village\u2019 programme. This minority government of the largest party only lasted nine months but its fame lives till date, 25 years on. In fact, the impressions it made on the popular psyche have not been removed even by the communist government of today that commands a nearly two-thirds majority in Parliament and has been around for more than two years.", "But today, the communists no longer inspire the masses. They have set all the bad examples. They are demonstrating the very traits that they had so painstakingly fought against during the partyless days. They have stopped living by the ideals they instilled in their followers.", "They have made a public mockery of their ideals and principles. Take for instance, how politicians, who were defeated in popular vote, were directly nominated for National Assembly seats one after another. Then there is the talk of amending the constitution so that the discredited Bamdev Gautam can go to the upper house and ultimately be appointed prime minister.", "Our communists today are embroiled in almost unimaginable crimes and malpractices\u2014land scams, trade in education and health, commissions, corruption, immorality, indulgence in wealth, pomp and love for the rhetoric rather than work.

His rebel militia, who would once have given their life for him during the decade-long Maoist insurgency, now view the same Prachanda with hatred for his life of luxury. Prachanda today roams around in a helicopter and takes refuge in resorts whenever he is in need of some solace after a hectic schedule. Prime Minister Oli\u2019s self-proclaimed aversion to corruption only sounds like lip-service when he is widely perceived to be surrounded by a corrupt bunch of people who command party and state affairs.", "These activities have greatly discredited the communist party, whom people showed great trust by giving it an overwhelming majority. Even party cadres are openly criticising their leadership for this blatant violation of principles.", "Our communist movement has been so badly exposed that even the ordinary farmer or factory worker can\u2019t trust the government. The common citizen is no longer assured that s/he can get their children good affordable education and they can have accessible healthcare.

Have we spared the political process through which a little known figure can rise and demonstrate great mobilising skills? Or will we revise our costly electoral system to save public faith in democracy?", "From grassroots level, people today are running after the communist party not because they love its principles but because they have vested interests. This affiliation can bring to them profitable opportunities. At the higher level too, people are engaged in politics so they might get lucrative state positions. How will this relation of sheer greed for money and power leave politics for the new generation?", "This erosion of ideals will only alienate the common people from politics and lead them to view their leaders with scorn and suspicion. When people harbour feelings that the rulers are not serving their interests, politics no longer represents the ground reality. It only becomes a hoax.

{"title": "Every month, an opportunity to learn about Nepal\u2019s contemporary art movements", "content": ["\u201cWe need to participate in this revolution\u2026,\u201d veteran artist Kiran Manandhar reminisced as he sat down with a group on a recent February afternoon at Martin Chautari. Manandhar was referring to the 2006 people\u2019s movement\u2014a period marked by unprecedented potential and possibilities for change\u2014and remembering an evening on the rooftop of Sita Bhawan in Naxal. The city was gripped by all kinds of protests then\u2014there were demands for ethnic rights and writers had also joined the movement with their own concerns. Over the decades, the fine arts movement in Nepal had proceeded by fits and starts and during the phase after the 2006 revolution, there was once again an opportunity to do something: primarily a need to recreate a public institution devoted to artists.", "Manandhar was speaking at the monthly Nepal Art History Discussion Series, initiated by Kathmandu Triennale, held at Martin Chautari, the Thapathali-based research institute. The session was the fifth instalment of the series and focused on the chancellorship of Nepal Academy of Fine Arts (NAFA) since 2008. ", "The Triennale describes the series as \u201ca long-form project that aims to bring to the fore the histories, work, and perspectives in Nepal, told through its artists and arts professionals\u201d and an attempt \u201cto fill the lack of proactive documentation and archiving of Nepali art histories and practices.\u201d By participating in these micro-discussions, the larger Nepali audience can learn about the history of art trends in Nepal as well as forge new bonds with the artistic community. This can, in turn, lead to further possibilities\u2014because the arts can provide powerful ways to inquire, critique and respond to dominant discourses and state structures. ", "NAFA was first established in 1965 by Birendra Shah when he was the crown prince. And even though artist Chandra Man Singh Maskey was appointed as the chairperson of the academy, almost no one in the administrative body could gauge the quality of artworks, Manandhar explained. Due to the restrictive and oppressive political climate during the Panchayat years, Birendra\u2019s gesture was viewed as tokenistic, even though the gesture stirred the artistic imagination of the public and a momentum, albeit gradual, started. The monarch had also donated the historic Sita Bhawan to NAFA but in 1977, due to an unfortunate restructuring, NAFA came under the total control of the Royal Nepal Academy. Bureaucrats with close ties to the palace were given administrative responsibilities; artists were pushed to the fringes and NAFA became completely stagnant.", "Frustrated with the situation, a group of artists established the Kalakar Samaj (Artists Society) in 1985 and appointed Manandhar as their leader. By that point, Manandhar and a few other senior artists had studied abroad and were exposed to the international art scene. They had witnessed, firsthand, how government institutions dedicated to fine arts could support emerging artists and organise large scale exhibitions. On one hand, this kind of public institution played a crucial role to cultivate art appreciation among the public and on the other, it also created a community that critiqued and challenged various socio-political norms. Despite genuine efforts by these artists, it would take more than two decades to release NAFA from the clutches of the Royal Academy.", "During the transitional period after the people\u2019s movement, artists organised themselves with fresh determination, walked down alleys and main streets, splashed public walls with paint, made their presence felt and voices heard. After much political lobbying, the new avatar of NAFA was born with its own administrative body. Kiran Manandhar was appointed as the first Chancellor in April, 2010, and under his leadership, NAFA started organising regular National Fine Art Exhibitions and putting together annual catalogues that compiled the work of prominent Nepali artists. In addition, NAFA also hosts exchange programmes with artists from South Asia. ", "During the February discussion, Manandhar was also accompanied by Ragini Upadhaya Grela who succeeded him as the Chancellor in 2014 and KK Karmacharya who took up the position in 2018. All three expressed that their work gets constantly interrupted by politics and bureaucratic hassles. For example, they have had to constantly negotiate with the government in order to protect the 22 ropanis of land owned by NAFA. And soon after Upadhaya succeeded Manandhar, Nepal was struck by the devastating earthquakes in 2015. Sita Bhawan was badly damaged by the quakes and Upadhaya had to lobby with politicians in order to retrofit the historic building instead of getting a new one constructed, a project that would be more lucrative for developers. Upadhaya also managed to increase NAFA\u2019s budget from Rs 30 million to over Rs 50 million and organise an exchange programme with Bangladeshi artists as well as artists from other SAARC countries. ", "What started as the Kathmandu International Art Festival (KIAF), organised by the Siddhartha Arts Foundation, in 2009 was renamed Kathmandu Triennale in 2017 with the intention of bringing together local and international artists to create exhibitions and encounters. For this year\u2019s festival, Cosmin Costinas is the artistic director, Hitman Gurung and Sheelasha Rajbhandari are the curators while Sharareh Bajracharya is the director. ", "The first session of the discussion series part of the Triennale was held in October, 2019, with a retrospective look at the emergent Nepali art scene during the 1960s and 1970s. The second session, titled \u2018Exhibiting Nepali Modernism: the 70s-90s\u2019 featured veteran artists Shashi Bikram Shah, Krishna Manandhar and Batsa Gopal Vaidya from SKIB-71, regarded as the first modern art collective in Nepal. SKIB got its name from the initials of the four founding artists\u2019 first names. Indra Pradhan, the fourth member, passed away in 1994. The final group exhibition of SKIB took place in 1995 but by that time all four artists had established themselves firmly in Kathmandu\u2019s thriving modern art scene. At the beginning of the talk, Shah\u2019s grandson shared his grandfather\u2019s archive which he has been working on for the past two years and it includes old photographs from the artists\u2019 younger days in Bombay as well as catalogues from art shows. ", "Representatives of various artist-led initiatives such as Kaasthamandap Artist Group, LASAANA/NexUs Culture Nepal, Gallery McCube, Bindu, and Bikalpa Art Center presented their works and answered questions during the third and fourth sessions of the series. Speaking about challenges and successes, prominent artivist Ashmina Ranjit highlighted the entry of the feminist dialogue in the Nepali art scene. She also commented on the changing perception of fine arts in the late 1990s. During a period when only painting and sculptures were regarded as art, Ranjit, in collaboration with other artists, introduced novel forms such as installations and performances. Ranjit also mentioned that all these initiatives were driven by passion. ", "In a society where school education is viewed merely as a means to attain \u201cworld-class\u201d technical achievement rather than creating a community of learners, youngsters should be encouraged to attend these discussions so that they can participate in the larger dialogue related to the Nepali art scene and social change. If we care about raising individuals who are concerned about Nepal\u2019s civil society, this series can prove to be a good starting point. In a capitalist climate driven by technological advances and material gain, when a kind of a social pathology has swept over youngsters, this kind of inquiry into social movements, historical conditions and the shaping of public institutions works powerfully against such pathologies. And as Ranjit mentioned, learning about passionate leaders from previous decades might inspire everyone to follow their own passions in order to create a vital and just society.

She had wanted to compliment her, instead, smiled in acknowledgement. \u201cYou have a very beautiful smile,\u201d Titir had said just then. It had made her happy. Titir had then reached out for her hands, held them for a moment, then dropped them suddenly; and they had sat in silence for the rest of the evening until it was time to go back to their rooms.", "In the days following that evening, she started to retreat into her shell. And here\u2019s the reason why. Titir had stopped talking to her completely. She would ignore her on the stairs, in the hall, and would seek company of her classmates constantly, so that she didn\u2019t catch her alone. For someone like Titir, who spent much of her time cooped up in her room, listening to Jagjit and Chitra Singh, it was a bit over the top. ", "One day, she wrote Titir a long letter and slipped it under her door. It didn\u2019t occur to her that the move would only cause her object of dedication to further stiffen against her. In it, she had asked Titir to explain what she had done to suddenly be subject to such treatment. She implored Titir to take her back. Implored! I am your chosen \u201csoul sister\u201d, she wrote. Had she forgotten? But it seemed like Titir had forgotten.

And in their place emerged slow days and sleepless nights.", "She would look out her window at the hillside and sometimes at the window that used to be Titir\u2019s.

Do you want to be punished like those people on Facebook?\u201d ", "A few days ago, I had shown her a video of police hitting a layperson for coming out of their house during the lockdown.

But she\u2019s also very unlike me; she is exuberant and loves talking to people. ", "But weirdly at this hour, during this time, I love the quiet. I love the clear sounds of birds chirping, of leaves rustling. I also enjoy watching my dog strolling and lazing about the house. There\u2019s no blaring sounds of construction or noisy vehicles. My home feels peaceful. However, sometimes this silence feels heavy and melancholic. ", "This quiet has unbalanced the equilibrium of society\u2019s notion of \u2018normal\u2019. The normal the three of us know, of leaving for work by 10:30 am and being home for dinner. Or the normal of chasing deadlines over family-get-togethers. For my mother, the normal of writing bills and coordinating supplies and selling equipment. For my father the normal of getting to university by 7:15 am to teach his students, and then rushing home for lunch to be in office by 11:30.

They have both been having a hard time coping with reality, as I sit all day with my laptop typing away at stories, or searching for ideas to write about. Their official work, unlike mine, cannot be done remotely, it requires movement. And hence, for them, everything is on halt. ", "And with the amount of free time they have now, the harsh reality of Corona feels even more penetrating. It\u2019s an overwhelming time where you fear about your loved one succumbing to the disease, of you infecting others and realising that death in this time will be tragically estranged. More and more thoughts to lose your strength over.

Especially to my second sister, who loves travelling. \u201c", "\u201d she said on Wednesday evening, and repeated on Thursday morning, then in the evening, and again on Friday morning and evening.

She washed the kitchen curtains the day before yesterday, and bedsheets and clothes that don\u2019t need washing right away\u2014all the while recycling the water for other household purposes. Every day she goes around the empty rooms looking for more work. In the afternoons, she calls up her sisters and talks about how the virus may spread, although she did the same thing the day before. And she regurgitates the facts she has heard from my father and my sisters to others. ", "My father is also always on the phone talking with people. When he\u2019s not doing that, he is busying himself with news updates. But Zuckerberg\u2019s Facebook has become his primary source for any information.

That kind of faith is sometimes stirring, powerful in its own way and something I have never experienced. ", "Yesterday afternoon both my parents went live on Facebook to recite an Aritara Path (protective verses), a prayer to Tara, a female Bodhisattva. Along with them, many of my father\u2019s friends went live around the same time chanting Buddhist prayers for protection and peace. The idea felt irrational at first, beyond my comprehension, but their faith felt sanguine. They had found a way to be social while maintaining distance and while simultaneously doing something they could talk about for the rest of the day. After their 45-minute prayer online, they received many calls from far-relatives and friends thanking them for their intercession. ", "On Thursday, my head was pounding with a migraine. The pain was incessant and so persistent that I thought I might have had the virus. With too many daily readings on Corona, I was starting to overthink about it. I checked my temperature more than three times that day. It was 96.7 degrees. ", "But daily, the three of us keep asking each other if we are breathing normally or if we have a sore throat. My mother leaves all the vegetables and fruits, even the milk packets under the sun for some time. \u201cIt kills the virus,\u201d she says.", "Almost every day we drink ginger-honey-lime-turmeric tea, as if it\u2019s going to kill the virus. My mother says turmeric helps with immunity; I don\u2019t know where she got that information from, but I drink it without any questions. One thing we have learned in this situation is to be grateful for what we have.

Whenever my mother wants some music to beat the stillness of the day, the speaker blares Veer Zaara or some Salman Khan songs. ", "But staying indoors also has, in a way, forced us to observe each other\u2019s lives and perspectives. It has closed in some distance that we have been feeling for a while. \u201cI know this shouldn\u2019t be a happy time, but I am glad that I am getting to spend time with you,\u201d my mother said as we both drank chiya on Tuesday. ", "Last week my father and I had a conversation we hadn\u2019t had in so long about music. He declared new Nepali music was \u201cnot immortal\u201d, and I told him that is because he hasn\u2019t listened to up-and-coming music properly. After that, I played songs of Bartika Eam Rai for him to understand her songs\u2019 meaning. Her songs have become a soothing milieu to the afternoon quiet; my mother now enjoys listening to her songs too. My father and I also grooved together to Bee Gees\u2019 \u2018Stayin Alive\u2019.

The isolation didn\u2019t alarm me either: I was thrilled about being by myself in the quiet. My mother slipped me meals and slipped away before she could no longer hold her breath; my father stepped in once he got home from work, wearing his white gloves and the scent of hospital rubbing alcohol, to listen to my lungs with his ice-circle stethoscope. As long as I coughed, I would be excluded from all family drama. When I heard shouting, I had permission to plug in my headphones and daydream. I had thought this would be, spoiled and obnoxious as it is, a recluse\u2019s heaven: left alone, not having to perform orderliness or feign interest for anybody. It turns out I, spoiled and obnoxious as I am, was not a touch equipped for isolation. ", "Three days into isolation, I had realised I wasn\u2019t who I thought I was. This was a crisis. I was no recluse: I hated being alone and dishevelled. I hated being unable to offer input, no matter how stupid or contrived, on the conversations I heard through the walls, no matter how stupid or hysterical. I especially hated that no one was looking at me. I took a disgraceful number of pictures of myself in various textures of light and was too ashamed to post them online, where everyone had become didactic and grim. There was no point in looking in the mirror at myself, either\u2014I had read that young women never saw themselves accurately when they looked in the mirror, anyway. I required someone else to look at me and to react to me, no matter how unkempt I was, so that I would know what to feel about myself.

I would distract myself by plodding along with work, with Jeanette Winterson\u2014whom I\u2019d started reading out of pure luck and who talks about so many separate selves with so much confidence\u2014with staring out my window at the fixed, white and leafy fa\u00e7ade of my neighbour\u2019s house, with the abnormally loud birds, or with a grisly line-up of American cult horror. But the betrayal of myself would always return and I would have nowhere to go, feeling like an imposter in my own body and not knowing to whom I should apologise for it. Besides, my cough was worsening. ", "I had known that the isolation would be self-revelatory\u2014solitude always is. It\u2019s not just a matter of being left alone with our thoughts in the silence. We experience silence every day, hours of it\u2014through the night, on the commute, in the hours of autopilot action that allows our brain to keep ticking along without having to focus or talk or listen. We consider ourselves constantly, our bodies and our ideas and how we appear to those we want to talk to or work with. We think we know ourselves, and we perform who we are, even in silence.

As my sense of self distorted until I had recreated a minor but eerie cult horror in my head, my energy levels plunged, lower than the drowsiness that the doses of prescribed codeine warranted for. Limbs ponderous, I lay in bed in a sweaty fugue with no memory of ever going to sleep or waking up. I dreamed that the neighbour\u2019s dogs climbed the trees in the night and perched at my window, and when I awoke to their barking I wasn\u2019t sure that it had been a dream. When I lay awake for too long, my arm moved by itself and frightened me awake. A slight fever came and left and came back.

Yet there was nothing I wanted more than to find a good patch of direct sunlight, somewhere people could look at me and I could look at them, and look at them looking at me. I needed to be able to perform in the eyes of others, just to feel like myself again. ", "The hours it took me to repair myself after eight days in isolation are unbelievable. It wasn\u2019t just my knotted hair, which took four hours and a great deal of upper-arm strength to fix, or my splotchy face, my cracked lips or the blue rings stamped around my eyes that needed attention. During lows in real life, I have consciously sacrificed how I look to conserve energy for the tasks that are binding\u2014like going to work and crossing things off my list of tasks and forcing down at least one of three meals.

", "Although the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice is consensual in nature, member states can accept its jurisdiction by issuing optional unilateral declarations. Such unilateral declarations, as decided by the World Court in Spain v Canada (1998), can also define the parameters of the concerned member state's acceptance. Nepal has never issued the optional clause declaration, and hence has not committed itself to getting involved in proceedings before the World Court. On the other hand, India while accepting the court's jurisdiction by issuing its latest declaration in September 2019, has subjected its acceptance to reciprocity and excluded matters concerning territories and boundaries from the court's mandate. Hence, utilisation of the International Court of Justice's forum is not possible without a special agreement between Nepal and India. ", "Nepal will be relying primarily on a variety of British colonial era map evidence dating from the time of the 1816 Sugauli Treaty to prove that the river originating at Limpiyadhura is the Kali, and ultimately the natural boundary line between Nepal and India. Many British colonial maps and historical documents have been unearthed for that purpose. But how much probative significance do maps hold in international law? And what if there are contradictory maps? ", "International adjudicatory settings have traditionally been cautiously hesitant to place legal value on maps, and although a new emerging rule affords maps evidentiary in merit (where they reflect the meaning of the treaty terms), the International Court of Justice has not completely denunciated the traditional rule. The reluctance to consider cartographic material as primary evidence as observed in Burkina Faso v Mali (1986) is partly due to concerns about 'neutrality of [map] sources towards the dispute in question and the parties to that dispute'. Other reasons why maps are disregarded or considered auxiliary evidence at best is because of the subjectivity of cartographers, political correctness of the geography being represented, and lack of aerial and scientific survey, especially during early colonial times. ", "Without expressly disapproving the conventional rule, the International Court of Justice has acknowledged maps on some occasions. In deciding that the Temple of Preah Vihear is located in Cambodia in a boundary dispute between Cambodia and Thailand (1962), the World Court relied on maps drawn by Thailand to impute its subsequent acquiescence. In Peru v Chile (2014), the International Court of Justice considered cartographic evidence to determine the starting point of the disputed maritime boundary. Although the World Court is careful about openly acclaiming maps, it has shown willingness to consider a map depicting a boundary line produced after the conclusion of a treaty. ", "Given the International Court of Justice's disposition towards maps, some words of caution are in order before Nepal enters into bilateral dialogue. Anticipate arguments that will be presented relying on conflicting maps, maps produced by Nepal hitherto, and river sharing agreements or boundary delimitation agreements concluded with neighbouring states; and be prepared to rebut with legal authority and reasoned historical and cartographical analysis.", "Maps can be used as one of the factors for legitimising or delegitimising territorial claims. However, more important than maps is the three-part rule constituting treaty law, ", " and effective control which the International Court of Justice regularly employs in settling territorial claims. The court is inclined to hear arguments based on boundary agreements because Article 38 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice considers treaties primary sources of international law.", "Boundary agreements are treated with greater gravity if they are undefective, clear and complete, and if they describe the frontier from point to point. Therefore, the Sugauli Treaty or other boundary treaties entered into by Nepal will continue to have some significance. Secondarily, the principle of ", " can also support Nepal's territorial claims. It can be posited that India inherited the pre-independence international territory as it was defined by its former colonial power, Britain.", "Finally, coming to a more controversial justification, effective control has been controversially considered the shibboleth for asserting territorial sovereignty. The meaning of effective control has not been defined unambiguously. Sometimes, it has meant uncontested administration of the land, and other times, abandonment of land or failure to maintain sovereign activity. There will always be competing claims of effective control. The International Court of Justice has also opined in some cases that effective control is lost if the state has acquiesced to the encroachment by the other state.", "In Belgium v Netherlands (1959), the World Court, however, also held that a state can prove non-acquiescence if it continuously asserts its rights over the title. Kalapani appears to be less contentious because Nepal has always protested the presence of Indian Army camps on its territory; and similarly, with regard to other adjacent parts of the border area, Nepal's exchanges and documentations asserting sovereignty and disclaiming India's purported exercise of administrative control will hold substance. ", "Steps initiated to amend the constitution have been reportedly paused for a national consensus. Observing this latest development, India commented that the 'matter is receiving careful consideration in Nepal'. An inquisitive Nepali populace is anxious to know if the map was released because the government was vulnerable to domestic public opinion or as a genuine effort to resolve the sensitive frontier issue. Let's sincerely hope no political party or leadership is expecting to benefit by establishing an adversarial position on a bilateral plane.

In these documents, the Mahakali river (sometimes named Kali, among others) as it flowed during the treaty signing has been set as the de facto border, with India holding all territories to the West (including the river bank) and Nepal the East. The contention arises from the movement of the river since then; more importantly, what is considered to be the starting point of the river. The Mahakali river comes into being from a confluence of streams and tributaries, feeding off a watershed. Nepal claims the watershed, and therefore the river, begins at Limpiyadhura.

", "A more recent and nuanced concept in this area is that of physician orders for life-sustaining treatment (POLST), which gives patients more options, and addresses the aggressiveness of care at the end of life in addition to the orders for resuscitation. This is particularly useful when a patient has gradual health decline, for example, due to terminal cancer or chronic lung disease, and there is a question, say of whether to intubate because of a complication such as pneumonia.", "Despite encouraging gains in the healthcare field in the past few decades, these end-of-life issues, especially for patients with incurable and terminal sicknesses, remain somewhat alien concepts in Nepal. One can partly blame the for-profit healthcare enterprise: Patients who can afford to pay continue to get aggressive medical care until the very end\u2014even when cure is no longer possible and a shift in focus to symptom control is needed. In many instances, lack of proper training of doctors on how to address these matters in a culturally sensitive manner is also to blame. ", "In addition, some doctors and hospitals are fearful of talking about end-of-life issues due to the culture of aggression and mistrust towards healthcare professionals. Finally, there is the question of patient autonomy which remains a weak concept in Nepal. In the absence of a clear patient voice, multiple family members often get involved in patient\u2019s decisions, complicating the picture, and making it difficult for the doctors to engage in effective end-of-life conversations.", "No matter what the cause, our inability to address end-of-life issues such as DNR and POLST has real consequences for the patients and families\u2014physical (for example, unnecessary tests and procedures), emotional and enormous financial costs. Despite these barriers and challenges, it is time we started to routinely ask our patients about their 'code status'. The importance of addressing the wishes of our patients for these end-of-life scenarios has never been greater\u2014especially given the low survival rates of Covid-19 patients who need intubation.", "Although asking for 'code status' is a routine practice in most parts of the Western world, this is not done routinely outside of the ICU in Nepali hospitals. Although the Nepal Medical Council\u2019s code of ethics and professional conduct guidelines clearly define the concept of DNR, the legal framework for its implementation is less clear. The most ideal setting to discuss the code status is when people are in stable health. In many Western countries, this happens when patients visit their primary care physicians. However, this is currently not possible in Nepal as the majority of the population lacks primary care physicians. ", "Another obvious avenue to address patient wishes for end-of-life care is in the hospital setting. At the time of admission to hospital, doctors should make every effort to discuss the code status\u2014meaning whether or not patients would like to be intubated if their breathing were to stop or revived if their heart were to stop beating. If a patient tests positive for Covid-19, doctors should revisit the code status by emphasising the high death rates and explaining that intubation and aggressive ICU care are likely to cause more harm than benefit. Hospitals and medical colleges should make efforts to train doctors on how to address code status in the most culturally sensitive and appropriate manner.", "On a societal level, hospitals and government agencies should collaborate to devise ethical guidelines to tackle potential ventilator shortages, and make it compulsory to document code status with every admission. The Nepal Medical Council and the government should address legal issues regarding the documentation and implementation of code status conversations.", "Covid-19 presents itself with an opportunity to accomplish a cultural shift by addressing these end-of-life issues, and potentially start a dialogue around broader goals of care and palliative care in our society. Although there are difficult conversations to have, even during 'non-Covid' times, patients and families should be given a chance to take charge of their outcomes. After all, the purpose of having these tough conversations early on is to empower patients and families to control what happens at the end, and to prevent societies and governments from making those decisions on the patients\u2019 behalf.

", "First, it goes against Article 51 (h) (2) of the Constitution, which provisions to \u2018make private sector investment made in education service-oriented by regulating and managing such investment while enhancing the State's investment in the education sector\u2019. Regulating private school investment does in no way mean burdening them with the additional task of uplifting the physical and educational qualities of public schools.", "Second, the mushrooming of private schools in the country is thanks to the failure of the public school system to provide quality education to a significant section of the population. The primary interest of private schools is capital accumulation even though they may strive to provide quality education in exchange. They can't thus be expected to be in a symbiotic relationship with public schools when the imperatives of the free market compel them to eliminate competition.", "Third, private schools are not always the epitome of excellence. Despite their apparent successes at achieving a higher pass percentage, they face multiple problems themselves, including having to rely upon low-skilled, pitifully paid teachers who work under less than favourable conditions. Moreover, no second private school in the country has the same wherewithal, financial or otherwise, to support another public school. ", "Fourth, private schools cater to a relatively smaller section of the population as compared with public ones. Of the total 35,520 schools across the country, only 6,687 are private ones. The one-on-one plan falls flat owing to the sheer numerical difference\u20143,745 private secondary schools against 7,105 public secondary ones. Moreover, private schools are concentrated in urban centres while public schools that need support are scattered across the country, making it practically difficult for private schools to engage with public ones in a meaningful way. ", "The finance minister's plan to entrust private schools with the responsibility of uplifting public schools, is, therefore, ill-thought-out as well as impractical.

{"title": "Limpiyadhura-Kalapani-Lipulekh dispute", "content": ["Nepal\u2019s publication of a new map showing the Limpiyadhura-Kalapani-Lipulekh area within its territorial boundary has raised passions here and across the border in India. The area in question, a 370-square-kilometre strip located at the north-western corner of the country, has been under Indian administration for a long time. But Nepal argues that, under the terms of the 1815 Sugauli Treaty, it is her land and should be returned. It looks like the newly unveiled map will bring India to the negotiating table. That is a good thing. History will tell whether the publication of the map was an effective strategy towards resolution of the dispute or a gamble with the potential for a long-term conflict with India.", "The territorial boundary of modern Nepal was defined by the Sugauli Treaty signed with the British East India Company in 1815. It said that the course of the Kali River, called the Mahakali downstream, marked Nepal\u2019s western boundary which is the subject of the current row. But there was no map attached to it; and if there was one, it has not been found. The Mahakali has two tributaries\u2014one starting at Lipukekh and the other at Limpiyadhura. The treaty did not specify which of these two tributaries would be considered the Kali for the purpose of delineating the boundary. India says the Kali starts at Lipulekh, and Nepal says Limpiyadhura is the river's source. ", "India (pre- and post-independence) has held the disputed area for nearly 200 years since the Sugauli Treaty was signed. Nepal\u2019s presence in the area has been sporadic and minimal, if any. India\u2019s active police post at Lipukekh pass, which was established during the British days, continues to date. There is also an Indian military establishment in Kalapani. ", "In the early 1960s, king Mahendra gave consent to Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru to continue the use of the Lipulekh-Kalapani area, according to the then Home Minister Biswabandhu Thapa. In 1961, Mahendra signed a boundary treaty with China, which says, \u2018The boundary line starts from the point where the watershed between the Kali River and the Tinkar River meet the watershed between the tributaries of the Mapchu (Karnali) River on the one hand and the Tinkar River on the other hand\u2019. This treaty makes Tinkar, about 10 kilometres south of Lipulekh\u2014the tri-junction where the China-India-Nepal borders meet\u2014and supports India\u2019s current position. ", "In 1991, Nepal formally raised the border issue with India, and a technical committee was formed to resolve it. The panel identified several areas with contested claims and resolved 90 percent of them. But, according to Nepali sources, India repeatedly baulked at Nepal\u2019s request for talks on Limpiyadhura-Kalapani-Lipulekh. The committee has not been active for the last few years. Since the Sugauli Treaty states that the area east of the Kali is Nepal, fixing the source of the river should resolve the dispute. Under the international convention, the tributary with the largest water volume or with the longest course carries the name of the main river. This would make Limpiyadhura the source of the Kali, but no border issue has been resolved on technical arguments alone. Realpolitik kicks in when solutions based on technicalities do not address the disputants' undeclared agenda.", "And there is one more complication. The new map makes the tri-junction at Tinkar invalid. Settling the location of the new tri-junction will require the agreement of all three parties\u2014Nepal, India and China. The long Indian presence in the area, the national security importance India attaches to the area, and the neglect by Nepali rulers for nearly 200 years to claim what rightfully belonged to Nepal has added to the complexity of the problem. ", "Given the lack of Nepal's presence on the disputed land for over 200 years, and the relative strength of India's economic and military might and international stature, it is doubtful much can be achieved by a confrontational approach or by internationalising the dispute, as some hotheads in Kathmandu are suggesting. Despite accusations by Indian opinion-makers' that Nepal is playing the China hand, China may not support Nepal's position. What China will do in the current dispute will depend on how it fits with Xi Jinping\u2019s global agenda of 'rejuvenation of China\u2019s glory'\u2014China\u2019s ambition to dominate the world. The Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson has already given an indication of their position: bilateral matter between Nepal and India. ", "Those who advocate internationalisation should ask what our fall back position is if India refuses to accept the World Court's ruling. The only option Nepal has is to try and resolve the issue through quiet diplomacy, through dialogue and forming Indian public opinion in our favour. This requires leadership with a very high moral standing; sensitivity, international respect, statesmanship, and an ability to communicate complex issues openly, politely, respectfully, and with firmness. ", "Prime Minister Oli\u2019s speech in Parliament was contrary to everything called diplomacy, respect, politeness and statesmanship. It was full of bravado and contained little substance. By mocking India's national emblem and declaring that 'the Chinese virus was better than the Indian virus', Oli was insulting 1.4 billion Indians. This is not how we can build Indian public opinion in our favour. What he did was shameful rabble-rousing, impolite and unbecoming of a prime minister, any prime minister. ", "Our opposition in Parliament and civil society is faced with a difficult problem\u2014simultaneously steering the government away from any major confrontation and towards a diplomatic solution on the border issue, and fighting the government\u2019s incompetence and complicity in pervasive political corruption that has hollowed out the country.

", "According to the ", ", Nepal\u2019s unemployment was estimated to be at 11.4 percent. This figure will only look scarier as this year unfolds. But if the government is serious about making the economy resilient after a pandemic, it must begin now. One way of doing so is ensuring the supply of rice seeds in the market. Rice grains contribute the maximum in agricultural GDP. If the government carefully studies the value chain, it could help move smallholders up that chain and eventually come up with a larger plan to ensure commercialisation of the grain which Nepali people are highly dependent on for their staple food. The government has a chance. It would be prudent if they jumped into action rather than indulging in a blame game and wasting time asking rhetorical questions.\u00a0", "***", "."], "author": null, "article_published_date": "", "article_updated_date": "Updated at : April 20, 2020 08:45 "},

From their first generation vehicles to their recent launches, TATA Motors have demonstrated many noteworthy improvements. Lately, TATA\u2019s compact sports utility vehicle, the H5, has been creating quite some buzz and looks to be the most optimistic vehicle from the manufacturer till date.", "The H5 is based on the OmegaArc platform, a re-engineered version of the platform commonly used by the mighty Land Rover. You have to see it in person to admire the character it exudes. It has a mighty road presence and it could very well be the most attractive Indian manufactured CSUV I\u2019ve ever driven.", "I took the H5 for a spin to Sundarijal and tested its performance and handling, and it would be an understatement to say it pleasantly surprised me. ", "The vehicle\u2019s front looks futuristic, with its LED DRLs and a menacing black grille, and while that might not appeal to some buyers, the front definitely has more fans than dislikers. The body is huge and muscular, however, the large wheel arches make the 17-inch rims look babyish. A bigger set of wheels could go more in flow with the muscular design of the H5. The rear is neat and tidy with a glossy back strip and tail lights on either ends completed with an embossed harrier badge in the centre. ", "Like the exterior, the interior of the H5 is classy. Its chocolate dark seats feel and look premium and paired well with a thick woodshaded dashboard. The fit and finish is perfect\u2014without any jagged, loose edges. The seats, both in the front and back, are well padded, spacious, and comfortable. There is adequate headroom as well as legroom for both the driver and the passengers. Adding to that, there is adequate storage for water bottles and cell phones. TATA has also been generous and provided the H5 with a massive 425-litre boot space. ", "The H5\u2019s instrument cluster feels refreshing. Its 8.8 inch infotainment system loaded with information is a welcome feature and supports both the Apple CarPlay and Android Auto but the system lags while working on the screen. For sound geeks, the premium speakers and subwoofers from world class JBL will be a value added delight. But despite its load of features, the H5 misses out on amenities like electronically controlled driver seats, sunroof, lock-open entryway button, and above all, rear temperature control AC vents. Can we ask for more features for the price of Rs58,55,000?", "The H5 is a 2.0 litre four-cylinder diesel turbo Kyrotec engine with 16-valves producing 140 horses and 350 Nm of torque. Its engine is produced by Fiat, the same power plant is also used by the Jeep Compass. Considering the weight of the vehicle and the power produced, it is safe to say that the H5 isn\u2019t the most exciting vehicle when it comes to outright performance. However, the performance feels more than adequate for its segment. The different drive modes available also lets you choose the way power is delivered. The engine felt best in the highways, but in stop and go traffic, I was left yearning for more mid range torque. The engine felt smooth and quiet in the lower RPMs, but once revved and pushed, I could feel the vibrations kicking in and the sound getting pretty buzzy.

The H5 felt right at home while on the rough terrain, with its ample ground clearance and long travel suspensions. It is a vehicle prepared to take a beating and shine no matter the conditions.

The Willys MB then made a name for itself as a light off-road capable military utility vehicle. The American vehicle was popularised to such an extent that we still call SUVs as jeeps. But there has to be a difference between an SUV and a jeep, right? The easy answer is that an SUV is not a Jeep neither is a Jeep an SUV. Why? You might ask.", "An actual advertisement campaign by the American automotive company Jeep in 2008 read, \u201cThey invented SUV because they couldn\u2019t call them Jeep\u201d. We all know SUVs are sports utility vehicles but what is a \u2018jeep\u2019? I surfed through the internet and came to a conclusion that \u2018jeep\u2019 is synonymous to a durable and rugged 4x4 whereas neither all SUVs are 4x4 nor all of them have decent off-road drivability.", "So that must mean that all vehicles produced by the American automotive giant are capable rugged off-roaders, right? I too had this question, so with high expectations I set out to find the answer with the entry level Jeep for the Nepali market, the Compass Sports Plus.", "The Compass Sport is definitely eye catching. Like all Jeeps, it too sports the miniature version of the iconic seven slot grille with the logo sitting on top at the centre. On either side of the grille are LED DRLs complimented with projector units. The front of the car looks menacing and will definitely turn heads with its bold looks and mighty street presence.", "As busy as the front of the vehicle is aesthetically, there isn\u2019t much to look at from the sides. The car follows the signature Jeep design cues with its muscular and boxy shape coupled with boxed wheel arches. The base variant of the Compass comes with good looking 16-inch alloy wheels with a five spoke rim.", "As with the sides, there\u2019s nothing fancy on the back with standard tail lights integrated with indicators and the reflectors sit beautifully coddled in the bumper. ", "The menacing look and muscular design of the outside is contrasted with a very comfortable, welcoming, and convenient interior. The silver and black contrasting used inside is pleasing to the eye and the quality of materials used is top-notch. The interior is loaded with features for convenience, like a full-length floor console with sliding armrest, dual zone automatic climate control, and armrest and cupholders for the rear passengers as well. Adding to the list, the steering column as well as the seats are height adjustable for the driver\u2019s comfort and a modern Electronic Parking Brake (EPB) replaces the conventional handbrake. Though the Compass Sport Plus misses out on keyless entry and leather upholstery, it still looks and feels premium.", "The Compass also gets a 3.5-inch infotainment system with Bluetooth connectivity which felt quite behind the times. Though the interface is intuitive, the hard to operate touch-screen leaves the infotainment system with a lot more to desire. But fret not, because you\u2019ll hardly ever use the touch screen while on the go, as the vehicle is loaded with steering mounted buttons, along with two buttons at the back of the steering wheel to change between radio frequencies and songs.", "All in all, the features combined with quality materials and stellar design gives the vehicle a very premium and upmarket feel.", "The Jeep Compass Sports Plus feeds on petrol and is driven by a 4-cylinder 1.4-litre Turbo Multiair engine producing 160 BHP at 3750 RPM and 250 Nm of peak torque at 1750 RPM mated with a six speed gearbox. ", "On the petrol variant I tested, the power delivery is linear and the gear shifts quite well but I was left yearning for more torque while off the road. Though the Compass Sports Plus propelled through the trails and cleared obstacles beautifully, the vehicle lacked a sense of urgency and excitement that I expected from a pedigree Compass. ", "However, it\u2019s a different ball game on the tarmac. The car handles very well for its size with precise power assisted steering and a light clutch making it a perfect city as well as highway commuter. Talking about the mileage, the company claims a ARAI mileage of 17.1 kmpl which further solidifies its position as a great commuter. But, with a width of 1818 mm and a length of 4395 mm, the Compass Sports Plus does feel a bit bulky if you\u2019re driving on narrow roads.", "A car that drives great is judged by its ability to stop. The Compass Sports Plus is loaded with disc brakes at the front as well as the rear. The brakes provide great feedback and stopping fast is not a problem at all.", "On the safety front, Jeep has cut no corners and provided the Sports Plus with the same safety features available on the higher end Longitude. It comes standard with EPC, ABS, Traction Control System (TCS), Hill Start Assist, and dual airbags. The vehicle earned a safety rating of four-stars overall from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration of USA (NHTSA).", "The Compass Sport Plus sports a McPherson Strut with Lower Control Arm Disc at the front and Multi Link Suspension with Strut Assembly at the rear. The suspension setup on the firmer side which makes hitting the twisties at high speeds a great fun. Though the suspension is on the firmer side, the Compass Sports Plus comfortably glides through small potholes and anomalies of the road. It\u2019s when you truly veer off the road, you start feeling the firmer suspension setup.", "On the comfort side of things, the Jeep Compass Sport Plus doesn\u2019t disappoint. The seats are clad in high quality fabric and provide ample cushioning and lumbar support, the automatic climate control works like a charm, and the ride quality is stellar while on tarmac. ", "I have no doubt that the Jeep Compass Sport Plus is an excellent and capable commuter, but a question remains. Should we tag it an SUV or a \u2018jeep\u2019. With a two-wheel-drive drivetrain and limited off-roading capabilities, I feel that the Compass tips the scale towards the SUV side rather than a true \u2018jeep\u2019 and that\u2019s perfectly fine.

One doesn\u2019t need a rugged 4x4 to commute to work, or go on a road trip with friends and family, what one needs is a practical and comfortable car and that is exactly what Jeep has been offering with the Compass Sports Plus."], "author": "Saras Sthapit Shrestha", "article_published_date": "", "article_updated_date": "Updated at : March 18, 2020 07:15 "},

The lake is of a dark, intense blue colour, lying still in its basin of grey rocks. Despite the winds, there are no waves, just a few small curls on the shores. The sky is lighter in colour than the lake but is just as flawless, without any clouds at all. I take a deep breath.", "When I planned this trip about a month ago, I was unsure if I would even make it to the lake. I took it as a trial for me, because I had never been on such high altitudes, and I was afraid I might get altitude sickness. Reinforcing my doubts was the timing of the trek\u2014it was already the end of November, many had warned me that the temperature might drop below zero degrees at night. So, standing at the shore of this lake, at 4,400 metres above sea level, was a great feeling.", "Retrospectively, however, it\u2019s funny how reaching the top seems secondary. A hike is not a mission, it\u2019s a journey. And it\u2019s journeys that have the potential to challenge and surprise us, not destinations. Hence, apart from the lake, there are many reasons why it is worth climbing to Gosaikunda.", "Situated in the Langtang National Park, Gosaikunda is an important pilgrimage site for Hindus. Lord Shiva is believed to have created the lake by punching a hole into the rocky landscape because he was desperate to satisfy his thirst after having been poisoned. Gosaikunda is also popular with trekkers because of its close proximity to Kathmandu, yet offer a very mountainous experience. I had booked a guide to accompany me, which is recommendable for solo travellers, who are not used to walking in high altitudes and don\u2019t know the area.", "As most people do, we started the trek from Dhunche, which is a seven-hour drive from Kathmandu. We arrived in Dhunche on the back of a jeep. Feeling a bit creased and dusty, we got off the jeep and went to a hotel. I was happy to discover that there was hot water and went for a shower\u2014the last one for the next four days.", "From Dhunche, the path first leads downwards for a while, to the Dhunche river. The path was littered with dry leaves and corns, which produced a cracking sound while we were walking. Following the river upstream, you eventually have to cross it and the path gets steeper. As I hadn\u2019t been doing much physical activity for some time, the climb proved tough. We took three short breaks before we reached Deurali at around 10:30 am. At Deurali, we stopped for lunch break. We had to wait for our dal-bhat for about half an hour but I didn\u2019t mind at all. I was happy to relax for a while and take a closer look at the surroundings. We were at a small tree-less plateau surrounded by the forest. The lodge was home to a family. Near the lodge was an old man ploughing a dry patch of land with his oxen, driving them while making funny sounds. Two kids of around two years were toddling around, their identical clothes were hanging stiffly on a washing line behind the house. The sky was grey and the peaks of the mountains in front of us were blanketed with white clouds, some of which looked like shreds of cotton wool. Looking to the southeast, I could see the valley of the Dhunche River from where we had come from. The dense forest mostly consisted of a mix of conifers and sal trees. On the way, my guide had spotted two langur monkeys brachiating through the thicket.", "Finally, the dal-bhat arrived. I was hungry and tucked in on the huge amount of rice the lady had served me. Right after lunch, we continued the trek but with my rice-filled stomach, the walk proved difficult. We had to climb about 700 metres to Chandanbari, our destination for the night. The path relentlessly climbed upwards again. When, after around two hours, we reached the quaint village consisting of a few lodges, a monastery and a cheese factory, I felt fine. But after a while, I got a massive headache. Chandanbari lies at 3,300 metres above sea and I was worried whether I would get any other symptoms of altitude sickness. I started drinking litres of hot water but it didn\u2019t get any better. A short visit to the monastery and the cheese factory\u2014both of which turned out to be closed\u2014didn\u2019t lift my spirits either. I was cold and extremely sleepy, and figured that only an early night would restore my energy.", "Luckily, the next day, my headache was gone and I felt motivated to tackle the next leg\u2014from Chandanbari to Laurebina. First, we walked through a forest of giant conifers. In between the dark, tall trunks, we managed to catch a brief glimpse of the snow-capped mountains of the Langtang Valley. After the stair-like path had led us out of the forest, we reached a sandy plateau from where we could see Langtang Lirung in its full majesty. We stopped there for lunch and I treated myself with a short nap on a bench inside the lodge. The sun was shining through the window, warming my face.", "As we continued walking, we crossed the tree line and the landscape changed to a desert-like, rocky wasteland, with dry, knee-length bushes. The higher we walked, the sparser the landscape got. The combination of the steep ascent and the low air pressure made me take heavy breaths. We had to walk slowly and take many breaks. We stopped at a Hindu shrine. Due to the lack of trees, I felt we were more exposed to the wind. The prayer flags were fluttering fast and produced a metallic noise when they banged against the pole. In the distance, I could hear the wind rushing through the forests of the Dhunche River valley.", "At around 2:30pm we reached Laurebina. Our lodge was built with stones and had a more alpine touch than the previous ones, all of which had a kind of a backpackers feel with Bob Marley posters and flags of different countries. But the one in Laurebina was scarcely decorated. It was much colder as well. The water in the buckets for flushing the toilet was frozen and white clouds of breath emerged out of my mouth when I yawned. When the sun was about to set, almost everybody left their warm place around the fire in the dining room and went outside to watch the sky perform its dramatic transformation from blue to black. Maybe it\u2019s because of the lack of oxygen that I started to have these funny thoughts. Seeing people marvelling at the red stripe on the horizon, they seemed to me as if they were paying tribute to the sun, which had warmed them all day long. Maybe the reason why sunsets never fail to amaze us human beings is that there is a distant, subconscious, infantile fear that we can\u2019t be sure whether the sun will return the next day. Why else would there always be such an awe-stricken silence when we watch a sunset, I wondered.", "Shortly after the spectacle, dinner was served and the fire slowly died out. The only warm place left was one\u2019s sleeping bag. Thus, like everybody else, I turned in at around 8pm and passed out immediately.", "The good news: the sun did return the next morning. It brought about a bright and clear day. The bad news: well, there wasn\u2019t any. The last few kilometres before Gosaikunda was one of the most scenic walks I ever had the chance to take. With the Annapurna range, Manaslu, Ganesh Himal, the peaks of Tibet and the Langtang Valley at our backs, we slowly climbed the last few hundred metres of difference in altitude. Eventually, the path flattened out, which led us around a rock that opened up the view of a steep, rocky slope. The sandy path was draped like a light brown cord from where we stood, guiding us to our destination. The walking became much easier and I started wondering what the lake would look like."], "author": "Gina Bachmann", "article_published_date": "", "article_updated_date": "Updated at : January 3, 2020 08:14 "},

The meat itself is close to right, but it\u2019s just a bit closer to tough. The syrupy sauce with fatty pork is satisfying, with some spicy addition, perhaps for what the restaurant perceives Nepalis desire.

The chicken, sliced into thin slabs, is glazed with the mixture of oyster and soy sauce and dotted with sliced chilli, but the probable addition of fish sauce is slightly overpowering. The sweet element is also slight, but the biggest problem is that the basil doesn\u2019t shine through. It seems to have wilted down too much to donate its full flavour. The sticky rice is a little dry too, which simply isn\u2019t good enough considering it goes for a jaw-dropping Rs 285 per bowl.", "What does work in Yum Yum Cafe\u2019s favour, however, is the fact that its entering into a field of cuisine that seems to underachieve on most fronts.

There was a group of three young men watching something on a smartphone; another group of men discussing a road being built in the village, and a pair of women discussed their days.

With his rich experience in content production, distribution and revenue generation, he and his team have been supporting new creators to find various platforms for their content to engage and create their own audiences. One podcast they are supporting is ", ", a podcast mainly focusing on European football leagues\u2014it has been gaining considerable momentum among sports aficionados.

", "\u201cIf it\u2019s on YouTube, I don\u2019t think you can call it a podcast,\u201d says Giri. \u201cThe essence and motivation are entirely altered when it is on a video-sharing platform.\u201d", "Acharya agrees with Giri. But his concerns are not about the definition of a podcast, rather surround the sustainability and costs, compared to audience engagement. ", "\u201cThe audio format has more scope and opportunity than the video format, and can cater across different platforms,\u201d he says. \u201cFor Nepal, it is still a unique idea and has a big opportunity for both independent creators and established media houses.\u201d", "***", "."], "author": "Asmita Manandhar", "article_published_date": "", "article_updated_date": "Updated at : October 22, 2019 07:48 "},

There is clearly a lack of dissemination of information among the police,\u201d said Adhikari, adding that due to such interference, they are losing on orders that are already few.

In two months, he has already faced losses of around Rs 600,000. With nine employees to pay and Rs 95,000 as rent for his restaurant\u2019s building, he decided to start delivering food to ensure some revenue was coming in. \u201cI was feeling a little stable, since I was getting as many as 30 to 40 orders and was making around Rs 40,000 per day,\u201d said Thapa.", "However, after the government announced to enforce the ", " from May 15 with the rise in Covid-19 cases, Thapa said that he had to yet again halt his business. \u201cThe police are now not approving my travel document.

But if I don\u2019t get to continue my food delivery service, I may have to send some of my staff on unpaid leave,\u201d said Thapa.

Fore spoke with ", " on the many areas that the organisation is working on in Nepal, from climate change and nutrition to mental health and improving the quality of education. ", "The following interview has been condensed for clarity.", "During the Scaling Up Nutrition Global Gathering, there will be a lot of emphasis on the impact of climate change on agricultural production, and it will be very good to carry the discussion forward here in the country. Nepal has made significant progress on stunting reduction through nutrition-specific interventions and social protection measures, both of which very much targeted families with children under the age of five. The current Multi-Sector Nutrition Plan that the Nepal government has developed with development agencies is not limited to nutrition-specific interventions. The plan also includes several interventions on other related sectors, including agriculture. ", "Education, at its root, has a lot of components. One of them is early education. Families have to realise that children between the ages of three and five need to be engaged with their mind and body in a way that results in a learning experience. ", "In primary education, one needs a relevant modern curriculum and competent teachers to ensure that children get the fundamentals of learning, which is being able to read, write and do mathematics. ", "In secondary education, it is essential to keep students engaged. If students find learning boring or they feel that they are not learning anything, they will lose interest in going to school. Many students tell us that they lose interest in secondary school, so the key is to make children excited about attending school. ", "Modernising the education system and connecting it with work is essential in today's world. There are 1.8 billion young people in the world today, making youth the largest demography in the world. We aim to ensure that the country's youth get the best education so that they can compete equally with youth from the world over. ", "The current frontier that we all share is the concern for quality of education. The investment parents and communities make in sending their children to school don't get paid off because the students do not get relevant education. UNICEF, as well as other partners, are working with the government through the education sector strategy. The work that we think needs continuation is coordination between public and private sector education. We are fully aware that a lot of the communities resort to private sector schools, which are costly but ensure better quality. But the private education sector is out of reach for the most vulnerable segment of the population. ", "The most important players in providing quality education are quality teachers. While a lot can be done at the policy level, providing guidelines and materials, if we do not have good teachers who themselves are well educated and who have a passion for education and to transfer knowledge, a lot of work at the technical level will go to waste. So having good teachers who are also willing to be placed in locations where they are needed the most is a challenge because teacher retention rates in rural areas is another challenge. So efforts have to be rolled out to work directly with local governments to get more teachers from those locations and provide them with the necessary training. These teachers will then have a stake in being the providers of education for the children in their respective localities. ", "In some countries, young people go door-to-door in villages and talk to parents who have taken their children out of school. They inform the parents of the importance of education and urge them to send their children back to school. There are also some radio programmes where parents talk to parents about the importance of keeping children in school, and how education makes children more productive and allows them to contribute to society.", "In Nepal, we have different programmes aimed at preventing child marriage. One of our main focuses is to have girls who have dropped out to go back to school. We also provide out-of-school alternative education and life skills programmes like Girls\u2019 Access to Education (GATE) and Rupantaran to address these issues. The focus though is not just on girls. We want both boys and girls enrolling in these programmes.", "Coming to the larger poverty eradication challenge, we are working with a number of partners to support the integration of the existing social protection measures in Nepal. The idea is to really focus on the most vulnerable groups to enable them to move out of poverty and not have them rely on support mechanisms forever. This will allow them to make sure that their children stay in school and that they have the required healthcare and that stunting is reduced.", "Nepal signed the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) in September 1992, making it one of the first countries to do so. I believe the country is very close to recommitting to it. We hope to get a recommitment from most nations in the world by November 20, which is World\u2019s Children\u2019s Day. One of the things that we have learned is that this generation has a voice and they want this voice to be heard. The focus for the next 30 years should be on realising these rights, and not just advocating for them. There should be some concrete programmes in place that will change things for young people. A nation\u2019s most valuable asset is its children, and they are what countries need to invest in. Countries that don\u2019t do that won\u2019t have great futures as nations.

The focus is to help rural communities take control of their water sustainability and safety. In urban settings, our focus has mainly been on cholera prevention.", "When it comes to mental health, our primary goal is to drive awareness, to keep the conversation on mental health going, and to reduce stigmas attached to it.

However, the recently endorsed education policy doesn\u2019t talk about broadening the state's responsibility in the education sector. The Post\u2019s ", " spoke to ", ", a member of High-Level National Education Commission who also follows left politics closely, about the new education policy, the state of constitution implementation and the course the incumbent government is taking", "This interview has been condensed for clarity.", "The high-level panel was formed to recommend the government on the steps it needs to take in terms of reforming Nepal\u2019s education sector. The education policy and the upcoming education laws are supposed to be an extension of those suggestions. But the endorsed plan largely ignored our recommendations. We had suggested increasing the spending on education to over 25 percent of the national budget, or six percent of GDP. Similarly, the suggestion also included a provision that makes it mandatory for people drawing benefits from the state to enrol their children in public schools, transforming the profit-making private schools into service-oriented ones, and converting them into trusts within a decade. ", "Making entire school education free and compulsory by 2030 and ending the practice of prime minister being the chancellor of universities, too, were our recommendations. However, except for our proposal to promote technical education, ensuring subject teachers and school infrastructure development, nothing has been incorporated in the education policy. The statute clearly says the country will take the course of socialism, but doing so won\u2019t be possible unless the state takes the responsibility of education and health. Regrettably, the incumbent Communist government is not interested in taking that course.", "The government has acted at the behest of the private sector. Our suggestions were targeted at improving public education and control commercialisation in the education sector, which was against the interest of private educators. They didn\u2019t want our recommendations to be implemented, and they have succeeded in doing so. This policy is nothing but an outcome of a mindset that ceases to challenge the status quo mindset and is clearly aimed at serving the interest of private school owners.", "It is. Let me tell you, even the private schools in those countries aren\u2019t profit-oriented. The ruling party committed a majority of our recommendations through its election manifesto. We recommended the government to at least come to be level of capitalist countries, if not be more progressive than them when it comes to providing education. No country has ever progressed without prioritising education. It does not matter whether the country is capitalist or socialist; it has been established that education and healthcare come under the state\u2019s responsibility. Finland, Norway, South Korea, Japan or Singapore, for instance, are not socialist countries, but education is their priority. Rwanda, which was devastated by the civil war, is witnessing an unparalleled development because it spends over 17 percent of its national budget in the education sector. I am saddened to see the education sector get a paltry 10.68 percent of budget share in the current fiscal year, especially at a time when a communist government is ruling the country. ", "It is pessimistic. The Acts on fundamental rights are in place because it was a constitutional obligation, but there are no regulations. The rights ensured by the constitution has been curbed while drafting the Acts, and they might be further stifled when regulations are enforced. The federal government doesn\u2019t seem to be interested in empowering the local and provincial governments. The constitution bestows the local government with every autonomy when it comes to regulating school education. Still, the centre, often owing to its reluctance to devolve power, creates hurdles in teachers' appointments and directs education-related laws not to be formulated. ", "The budget allocation is unjustifiable. The local and provincial governments hardly get 30 percent of the total national budget while the centre has kept 70 percent with it. How can the federal government that only has three authorities\u2014diplomacy, defence, and monetary policy\u2014justify its action to keep a large chunk of the national budget with it? The allocation should have, in fact, been the other way round. ", "Parties touted taking Singha Durbar to people's doorsteps during the election. Still, once they assumed power, their way of action is no different than the way a government would have acted in a centralised system of governance.", "The scenario of resource distribution is no different. There is an acute shortage of human resources at the local and provincial level despite the authorities being halfway through their tenure. The inclusive commissions are considered as progressive measures adopted by the constitution, but they lack the needed staff. The main achievement of constitution implementation is holding the election of the three tiers of government successfully. The government's actions reflect its unwillingness to abide by the spirit of the constitution.", "I won't say it hasn\u2019t done anything. I see some satisfactory performance in diplomacy. The relation with our friendly nations, including the two neighbours, has bettered. The Ministry of Energy and Ministry of Labour are doing some commendable work. Yet, there is much to be desired. The government had announced grand plans of progressive land reforms and of making Nepal self-dependent on agricultural products within two years. But it has failed miserably in this respect. Its announcement to increase irrigation facilities hasn\u2019t materialised, either. ", "The dominance of the middleman is growing while farmers and consumers continue to be cheated. The government\u2019s announcement to end the syndicate remains unfulfilled. There aren't any visible results in increasing industries and employment generation. Sure, there are talks about building railways and Nepal operating its ship. These are necessary, but the government\u2019s priority should be to bring some visible changes in the daily lives of the general public. The citizenry will never believe such announcements of implementing a water transport network or running trains unless the authorities concerned fill the potholes in the streets, control pollution or ensure a regular water supply. The government never fails to boast its two-thirds majority, but what it says is merely political rhetoric. ", "I haven\u2019t yet figured out the government\u2019s priority. It seems to be working in an ad hoc basis. It seems the prime minister himself isn\u2019t clear on what he wants. There should be no problem for a government that has a thumping majority in Parliament to implement what it wants. If it doesn't correct its ways of functioning, the Oli-led government could very well be the most unpopular government. ", "The merger of then CPN-UML and then CPN (Maoist Centre) was not organic. It was arithmetic and not ideological. But ideology is fundamental in politics. The NCP would have been stronger and functioned smoothly had the alliance been based on ideology united by a common goal to change the face of the country. However, KP Sharma Oli and Pushpa Kamal Dahal\u2019s merger bid was based on political calculation. Therefore, there seems to be no problem in the party when the two factions, then UML and Maoist, are on the same page in power-sharing, the day Maoist doesn\u2019t get what it was promised, Dahal starting Oli.", "Both Oli and Dahal merely keep their words. Dahal left Oli to support Nepali Congress to form government in 2016 after Oli denied him prime ministerial berth.

The future of the party depends on how well the power-sharing is maintained within the party.", "The deal was Oli and Dahal would lead the party and government alternatively. Observing Dahal, I can say that he has a preference for being the numero uno. Though he is co-chair of the party, Oli often overshadows him. Dahal's public remarks reflect his frustration over being treated as a second man. I feel Dahal won't feel at ease being in his current position for long. Oli has to sacrifice either his prime ministership or party chairmanship if he wants to keep the newly formed Nepal Communist Party intact. But in my opinion, Oli would be ready to hand over the party\u2019s responsibility to Dahal as a last resort.\u00a0"], "author": "Binod Ghimire", "article_published_date": "", "article_updated_date": "Updated at : November 19, 2019 09:29 "},

The runway rehabilitation is already complete while the taxiway rehabilitation will be completed by December. As aircraft are occupying the runway or using it as a taxiway to reach the takeoff point, the time for a plane to takeoff has doubled to 4 minutes. This has resulted in significant flight delays and congested the airport as well. From January 2020, airport congestion will be reduced significantly as it will be able to handle flights 24/7. After the rehabilitation of the taxiway is complete, the airport will be opened for 21 hours.", "As delays are basically during the day time\u2014from 2 pm to 6 pm\u2014we are also revising the slot allocation time for both domestic and international airlines for proper traffic management.", "The project ran into controversies from the beginning, and there are still many problems.

If the disaster occurs in one place, which is far away from Kathmandu, are responders able to reach there easily or do they need helicopters? These are important points.

But hardware alone can\u2019t exist in a bubble which is why Apple has released their new MacOS Catalina to support their new hardware upgrades.", "MacOS Catalina is currently a free upgrade for all Mac-users, for computers as old as ones from 2012. Thankfully, the new OS feels more like a full-fledged desktop OS rather than an upscaled version of iOS. The operating system also comes loaded with features that help productivity while also creating a more synchronous relationship with other devices within the Apple ecosystem. But while MacOS Catalina offers some interesting new features, it also comes with its own caveats. Here we look at some of the most important features as well as the downsides that might push you to hold back from upgrading right away.", "This might be the most important feature to come out of Catalina. Bridging the gap between Macs and the iPad, Sidecar lets you use your iPad as an extension of your Mac by utilising it as a secondary display. This is a very handy feature if you don\u2019t have a secondary display and working with sidecar with your editing videos or even streaming can be monumentally useful. I used an iPad as an external monitor during my video-editing sessions, leaving the 13-inch display of my Mac open for an expanded view my video timelines. Similarly, having an external secondary device makes it really easy for users to compare and contrast data and information while working on articles or even data entry jobs.", "Furthermore, the iPad can also be used as a drawing tablet for creative professionals. If you don\u2019t have a Wacom, sidecar lets you pair your iPad with an Apple pencil for precise design and digital illustration work. With iPad OS and an improved Apple pencil, the latency between the two devices has dropped to a mere 9 milliseconds, making both of these offerings by Apple a competitive option for creatives.", " ", "iTunes has remained a pain point for both PC and Mac users for years. With more and more features added to the application, it just got more bloated over the years, turning into a major resource hog on both devices. Finally, in Catalina, Apple has decided to let it rest by diving all of iTunes features into smaller applications that are much easier to manage. All device controls have now been delegated to the Finder and Podcasts and Books now have their own dedicated applications. Traditional music handling has been bundled with Apple Music for a more streamlined experience without all the clutter of the older iTunes.", "While it was in Apple\u2019s best interest to separate iTunes into different applications, the applications itself has been a major part of MacOS. Its removal will cause many issues for applications dependent on the iTunes library. Many music production programs are still dependent on iTunes libraries and with the removal of iTunes altogether, many of these applications might run into problems and might even stop working altogether. Regardless, all the new applications are snappier and conform more to Apple\u2019s UI design aesthetic that bring it closer to the experience on their other devices.", " ", "Windows PCs have been the go-to devices for gamers for a very long time. Apple could never compete with Windows\u2019 DirectX gaming platform and thus many game developers release their games for Windows refraining from acknowledging Mac as a viable device for gaming. This changes with Catalina. Apple Arcade is a monthly gaming service that currently offers more than 100 games across their platforms including the computers. While a 100+ games is still pretty limited, when compared to the vast library of games on Windows, access to an official Apple platform for gaming might push future developers to consider Mac for its potential gaming appeal. Also considering how Apple\u2019s ecosystem is more comprehensive than Microsoft\u2019s with Apple TV, iPad OS and iOS, cross device support might further propel gaming on all of these devices. ", " ", "Apart from these major updates, Catalina also brings support for their mobile apps on the OS, bringing the same apps that you love on your iPhones and iPads to the Mac. These applications aren\u2019t haphazardly put together as applications that scale to a larger screen, however, rather they conform with the larger UI aesthetics while retaining the familiarity offered on mobiles. Currently, Apple offers News, Voice Memos, Home and Stock on Catalina with more apps like Twitter, TripIt, Rosetta Stone and GoodNotes in the pipeline.

The Nepali Congress believes in democracy, so obviously, there will be different opinions in such a party. But yes, it\u2019s important to properly manage such differences. ", "There are two aspects to this issue: one pertains to the internal mechanisms within the Nepali Congress, and the other pertains to the role it plays in larger national politics. In the past too when Girija Prasad Koirala was the party president, there were differences of opinion: about whether or not the Maoists, who were rebelling then, should be integrated into mainstream politics. In the end, we were able to sign the ", " with the Maoists in 2006. Similarly, factions caused intra-party issues while we were writing the constitution too. Yet, when it came to national politics, the Nepali Congress was able to work with other parties to successfully complete writing the constitution. We did the same regarding the local, provincial and federal elections a few years back. So we\u2019ve always had internal conflicts, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean there is no unity within the party. ", "There are new leaders emerging all the time. There was a time when the party was led by the charismatic BP Koirala. But it takes time for a new leadership to become mature once the old one is gone. Sometimes, a new leadership\u2019s achievements are overshadowed by the old one\u2019s legacy. Ganesh Man Singh, for example, built on BP Koirala\u2019s legacy. Singh was succeeded by Krishna Prasad Bhattarai, Girija Prasad Koirala and Sushil Koirala. They all helped establish democracy, write the then constitution in 1990, bring Maoists to mainstream politics, and write a new constitution in 2015, respectively. And under Sher Bahadur Deuba, the country was able to hold elections, which helped institutionalise federalism. ", "So any leadership must be judged in terms of its contribution to national politics. It was possible to end the decade-long insurgency during GP Koirala\u2019s time, but at the same time, the Nepali Congress failed to get the desired electoral results. It\u2019s important to take a middle ground while evaluating leadership. Instead of looking at the current situation as a leadership crisis, it must be viewed as one beset with new challenges that warrant innovative ideas for solving the party\u2019s problems. ", "BP Koirala actually led the party as a young leader. He became prime minister before he was 50 and so did Sher Bahadur Deuba. In fact, when the party was established, we had many young people who achieved many things as they got older. In recent times, the number of young people joining and leading the party has increased. In 60 out of 77 districts, cadres who entered politics through the Nepal Students Union are now district party chairpersons. We will have even more young people following the 14th General Convention. But it\u2019s important to note that there are two ways through which youths are represented. One is through the issues they raise and the other is by being the face of the party. ", "Regarding some of the issues raised in the last decade\u2014the constitutional assembly issue or turning Nepal into a republic\u2014our party\u2019s youths were at the forefront. Today too, it\u2019s our youths who take up issues pertaining to the rules of democracy, decentralisation of power and so on. So their representation in terms of raising agendas has been prominent, and after the upcoming general convention, their visibility as the face of the party will increase too. ", "Actually, the number of seats retained by the Nepal Communist Party did not change. There are multiple ways to analyse electoral results. For example, the Nepali Congress did lose the by-election for ward chair in Punarvas Municipality in Kanchanpur. We had lost that seat before too. But before, the party was able to get only 78 votes. This time around, we got 310 votes\u2014a remarkable increase. In the past, when the erstwhile Communist Party of Nepal and Maoist Centre fought for the position separately, they were able to get 610 votes in total. But now, the number of votes they have received is less than that sum total. Meaning, the Nepali Congress has narrowed the vote margin. Similarly, in different areas in Dharan and Chitwan, too, our party has increased its vote count. ", "So if we consider just the number of seats, the Nepali Congress lost one seat this by-election. But we have decreased the vote margin, along with increasing our popular vote count by 7.6 percent. We have fared better than before; that said, the results should have been much better. ", "We are not providing legal support for ", " the individual. The Nepali Congress believes in the rule of law; therefore, the party will support the investigation, not the individual. We believe that only the guilty should be punished. ", "When the Oli-led government was formed, the conditions were favourable as compared to when governments were formed before. The country is no longer embroiled in an internal conflict, nor do we have to deal with a monarchy. Earlier, Nepal was living through many crises, and because of that to some extent, the citizenry was willing to give the government some benefit of the doubt. But things have now changed for the better and it's time to deliver. ", "The opposition party is willing to be called a \u2018weak opposition\u2019, but, unlike other opposition parties in the past, we will not resort to any kind of destructive behaviour to hinder government processes. In the last two decades, when the Nepal Communist Party was in the opposition, it called for Nepal bandas almost two dozen times. But we as the opposition have never resorted to calling bandas or vandalising public property. The opposition is thus cooperative and the ruling party enjoys a two-thirds majority. And yet, the Nepal Communist Party has not been able to prove itself. ", "When people elect parliamentarians, the leaders are being asked to implement the policies they campaigned on. All that we as the opposition can do is find the loopholes in the policies presented by the ruling party, or show them where they\u2019re violating the system when implementing policies.

We are the only truly safe and secure app out there. If you look at the competition over the years, Facebook messenger is not end-to-end encrypted, WhatsApp is owned by Facebook and gone on record saying that they share all the information with Facebook. The reason I am being very open about it is that this is open knowledge. We are not part of any social network where we need to use this data to earn money somewhere else. And we are not small. For us, we put user privacy on top of money. ", "One of the interesting things which was launched recently is 'Create your own sticker'.

Before being elected as the president, he had served as the vice-president of the institute for the year 2018-19. A chartered accountant himself, Acharya had earlier served as the Chief Executive Officer of Employees Provident Fund for 5 years. Amid questions being raised about professional integrity of various professionals, including public servants, ICAN recently organised a conference on professional integrity for combating corruption in Kathmandu. The Post\u2019s ", " spoke to Acharya how ICAN as a regulatory agency can play an effective role in tackling corruption.", "More often than not, politicians and bureaucrats get implicated in corruption cases. But at times, when various professionals fail in their professional duties, it ultimately promotes corruption. We organised the conference to convince professionals of their roles in curbing corruption. ", "If professionals like engineers, lawyers and accountants maintain professional integrity, they can make it difficult for anyone to become corrupt. ICAN also organised this conference to promote professional integrity among professionals themselves. We\u2019ve just made a small beginning, and we hope other regulatory agencies such as the Nepal Bar Council and Nepal Engineering Council follow suit and help combat corruption.", "There is a general perception that once chartered accountants or accounting professionals take charge, there should be no fraud in any company. But there might be lapses because auditors audit transactions conducted over a financial year in a month or two. The auditor is responsible for reporting non-compliance of any laws and regulations by a business enterprise. But auditing and investigation are two different things unlike what many believe.", "An audit is a process of examining management practices and internal control systems based on documents provided. An auditor does not investigate like the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) or the Central Investigation Bureau of Police. But yes, auditors can sense massive frauds. An audit cannot be completed if the auditor starts work by assuming there is a fraud. An auditor must begin work with the assumption that there is no fraud. But when they sense any fraud, they must review it and report it to the concerned authorities. The auditor must flag the loopholes in internal control that may lead to fraud and suggest remedies. But if a firm does implement the auditor\u2019s suggestions, the risk of fraud remains. Auditors\u2019 reports are therefore crucial for investigating agencies to look into financial fraud in any establishment. ", "We cannot generalise as there are people with ill intentions at an individual level everywhere. As a regulatory body, ICAN, on its part, needs to watch the activities of its members. We provide 30-hour CPD (continuous professional development) training to our members annually towards promoting professional integrity. But chartered accountants are facing such kind of blame globally too. To change such a perception, the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC), our umbrella organisation worldwide, conducts necessary research and prepares standards and codes of conduct. The IFAC also developed a new reporting format recently. As per the new format, an auditor should mention \u2018key audit matters\u2019 in the report, which means that auditors need to report the key risk areas they looked into and what they found. We are gearing up to implement this format from the next fiscal year. This will help detect potential major frauds in time. What\u2019s more, we even scrap the licence of individual members who go against our code of conduct.", "We had received 92 complaints against auditors in the last fiscal year, and we settled 80 of them. Seven cases are under consideration in the disciplinary committee while five cases have been sent to the Council for the final decision. ICAN has even suspended its members for up to three years. Members suspended for three years cannot do an audit of any limited company for an additional three years. Members who get a warning from the ICAN disciplinary committee cannot audit for three years as per the Company Act. ", "We have not publicised the names of such CAs so far but will do so soon. Considering the possibility of such CAs continuing auditing despite facing action from ICAN, we plan to publicise their names on our website, including the type of action taken against them. If somebody gets a clean chit, that will be made public, too. ", "They don\u2019t fall under the purview of ICAN. We regulate professional accountants who work in the private sector. The government accounting staff face separate disciplinary actions from the government authority as per the Civil Service Act. Government accountants registered as auditor and member of ICAN should also follow our code of conduct. There are registered auditors in government services too. So far, no complaint against them has been registered here, and none of the auditors slapped with corruption charges by the CIAA is a member of ICAN.", "We have taken this issue seriously. Now, we have also been receiving complaints that firms are submitting their audit reports with the signature of fake auditors. So ICAN has introduced a new system called UDIN (Unique Document Identification Number) from this fiscal year. Under this system, each ICAN member should enrol with the UDIN. Each time he/she signs the document after auditing, they should mention the content of the audit as well as the name of the company. The system then generates the UIDN, which the auditor needs to mention in the document he/she signs. ", "The auditor needs to go through a similar process and get a separate UDIN when signing the audit of another company. Our system thus generates a database of work history of auditors. After we introduced this system, we have been working with the tax authorities to make it mandatory from the tax office too. Likewise, Nepalis visiting abroad, such as the USA and Australia, should also get their asset valuation certified by a CA. Such certification also requires UDIN. So this will end the practice of firms making double balance sheet.", "ICAN\u2019s code of conduct is like the holy book for us. We prepared it to promote self-discipline among members. We brief our members about the code of conduct regularly, and the CPD programme is one such effort. ICAN is working towards institutional and legal reforms to address this concern. We are reviewing our organisational structure by bringing in experts from outside as well. We are studying the possibility of introducing a robust regulatory body with professional staff to investigate complaints filed against any ICAN member and submit a report to the disciplinary committee for necessary action.", "It is similar to the CIAA\u2019s modus operandi where an investigation officer conducts all necessary investigation before submitting the file to the meeting of commissioners for final decision. We will have a robust regulatory department with a professional team of investigators. As of now, the disciplinary committee looks into it and the teams support the committee. We have now engaged an external team of experts to study if we have to amend the law to strengthen the ICAN\u2019s regulatory function, making it more resourceful. ", "There is some concern about whether elected ICAN council members would adequately look into the accounts of their regular clients. In such a situation, concerned members are barred from participating in the decision-making process. Such members should submit disclosure about their relations with any business firm, failing which they face action from ICAN itself. But even in the current structure of the disciplinary committee, there is no such problem as we have representation from the Office of the Auditor-General and the Finance Ministry. It is already quite independent now, and we believe that strengthening staff size will be of further help.", "The auditor-general\u2019s report is made public, but the audit conducted by our members is shared among the shareholders. An auditor of a private firm should not expose the audit report. Regulatory agencies take action based on the audit report. For instance, if any bank is found to have not adhered to the Nepal Rastra Bank\u2019s directive in the audit report, the central bank takes necessary action. An auditor can say it is not earning asset or good asset in the case of a bank, do 100 percent provisioning and identify the weaknesses and risks, but they do not conclude those transactions as being fraudulent. At times, the auditor does not disclose all the issues in their final audit report, so we are preparing to implement reporting guidelines that makes it mandatory for the auditor to report key audit matters.\u00a0"], "author": "Prithvi Man Shrestha", "article_published_date": "", "article_updated_date": "Updated at : December 31, 2019 08:59 "},

", "The Post\u2019s ", "talked to ", " VisitMadhesh\u2019s chief operating officer, about the initiative and how they plan to make the initiative a success and the challenges in doing that. Excerpts:", "We came up with the concept in 2018 and started working on it from thereon. We felt the need to start this initiative because Nepal\u2019s tourism is very limited to the mountains and hills of the country. Since all of us come from Tarai, we were aware of the region\u2019s tourism potential and how the region could contribute to adding another dimension to Nepal\u2019s tourism. ", "In 2018, one of the first things we did was travel to all the districts in the Tarai region, from Jhapa in the east to Kanchanpur in the west. The reason behind doing so was to collect as much information as we could on different attractions\u2014from religious, cultural to natural\u2014that could be of interest to tourists. Based on our findings, we came up with a 98-page document, which we submitted to the Nepal Tourism Board. ", "We then created a team in each and every district so that we could plan and coordinate our activities in the region. We have been mobilising the teams to conduct clean-up campaigns in historical and religious sites in the respective areas, and have also conducted tourism awareness campaigns. We have found the latter very important because the tourism industry is non-existent in many areas of the region. Getting the local governments and citizens and convincing them of the important role tourism plays in socio-economic development has been one of our core focuses. ", "Apart from that, we also set up teams in 12 countries to help promote the region and to connect expats from the region living in those countries with our work, and how they could contribute to making the region realise its tourism potential.", "Even though the region has what it takes to attract a lot of tourists from all over the country and abroad, what it lacks is tourism-related infrastructure. Most of the hotels in the region are congregated in destinations that are already popular among tourists, for example Janakpur, Lumbini, Bardiya and Nepalgunj. But many of the hotels aren\u2019t standardised. If we are to attract more people, we will have to improve on that. We are already in talks with various government and non-government institutions we could collaborate with to provide hospitality training to hotel staff in the region. There\u2019s also a lack of tourist guides. We are also working on how to provide guide training. ", "But one of the major challenges we have observed has been convincing the government officials to look beyond the country\u2019s traditional tourism approach of focusing only on mountains and hills.", "A flourishing tourism industry across the region will help create jobs in the local communities, help preserve age-old traditions, convince the local communities the importance of conserving and protecting important cultural and historical sites. Tourism will also help create a market for local products and handicrafts. ", "One of our key focuses is getting more domestic tourists from mountains and hills of the country. We believe that the best way to understand a culture and people is to travel to where they live. So, if we get more tourists from other regions of the country, I think it will help dispel a lot of negative notions about the region that exist. This is important to strengthen the bond among us Nepalis and help us understand and empathise with each other. ", "Oh, there are too many. Linga in Kanchanpur is a very important religious site that is very popular among locals but is relatively unknown to the rest of the country. Similarly, there\u2019s Kailali\u2019s Ghodadhodi Tal and Tikapur Park; Bardiya\u2019s Krishnasar; Kapilvastu\u2019s Jagdishpur Reservoir; Makwanpur\u2019s Sahid Smarak Park is the biggest park dedicated to the country\u2019s martyrs; Sarlahi\u2019s Nadi Tal, are among some of the attractions of the Tarai.\u00a0"], "author": "Tsering Ngodup Lama", "article_published_date": "", "article_updated_date": "Updated at : February 21, 2020 07:58 "},

Agreeing to his observations, Arunima says, \u201cThe nine living chaityas in the Temple Court are replicas of shrines built between the 11th and the 18th centuries.

According to Buddhist philosophy, chaityas represent the universe, and each spire that encircles the chaitya symbolises heaven; the gods and goddesses are believed to be living inside the chaityas.

{"title": "Familiar yet different", "content": ["\u201cDid you buy a new phone?!\u201d, my colleagues asked when I showed them the latest S20+ from Samsung. They were surprised that I was carrying around Samsung\u2019s newest flagship considering I had bought the S10 less than a year ago. On paper, both my S10 and the latest S20+ are IP68 water-resistant, have ultrasonic in-display fingerprint sensors and amazing AMOLED displays. However, the S20+ does have a few aces up its sleeve with the blazing-fast 120Hz display and \u2018revolutionary\u2019 camera setup. But is it enough for me to switch? Let\u2019s find out.", "The S20+ is a big phone yet it feels strangely comfortable in the hand. But it is still a tall phone nonetheless. Horizontal reach and one-handed typing are fine but you will have to do some finger gymnastics to reach the top of the phone unless you have the hand span of an NBA player. I did not have a case on the S20+ and it was slippery as an eel.", "The curved screen on the S20+ is also more subtle compared to last year's models. There is less chance of accidental touches when shifting the phone in your hands. Samsung has managed to shrink the top and bottom bezels ever so slightly to give the S20+ an insane 90.5 percent screen to body ratio. For comparison, Apple\u2019s iPhone 11 Pro Max has a measly 83.7 percent screen to body ratio. And there is no notch taking up valuable screen estate, just a small camera hole. I thought watching YouTube on my S10 was immersive but on the S20+, it just sucks you in.", "And there is absolutely no question that Samsung makes some of the best displays in the market. And this year, Samsung is raising the bar even higher. The 6.7-inch AMOLED display offers unbelievably vivid colours that just pop off the screen. The display on the S20+ is also HDR10+ certified and has a 120Hz refresh rate. This means that the screen will refresh up to 120 times every second to give you an even smoother experience while using the phone. But to use this high refresh rate, you will have to dial down the native QHD+ resolution to FHD+. I was initially skeptical about the 120Hz screen as I did not want to sacrifice resolution for a high refresh rate. But after using the S20+, I can safely say that I am all for a screen with a high refresh rate. The difference is like night and day. You notice smooth navigation throughout the OS as well as in games. I\u2019m just worried that I have to go back to my \u2018slow\u2019 S10 which has a 60Hz screen like most smartphones. Using the S20+ in direct sunlight is no problem as the display can achieve a peak brightness of up to 1200 nits. Once again for comparison\u2019s sake, the iPhone 11 Max Pro only hits 821 nits.", "Samsung boasts that its S20 lineup will change the smartphone photography landscape. But does it really? Sure, you get three rear cameras on the S20+, a 12-megapixel (MP) wide-angle unit, a 12MP main camera and a 64MP 3x zoom lens. And on the front, a 10MP unit handles selfies. The wide-angle and main camera produced similar photos to my S10. Excellent photos in daylight but nothing too game-changing. The S20+ does produce sharper images than my S10 but I had to really zoom in to find differences and at that point, I was really just splitting hairs. But I was curious to test the 64MP unit the most. Samsung says that it uses multi-frame \u2018space-zoom\u2019 to achieve up to 30x zoom but I was not impressed with the quality. The photos come out grainy and you need lots of sunlight to make it work well. You will have to set it up in a tripod to reduce the camera shake for the best results. To me, it feels more like a party trick to wow your friends. ", "However, low-light photos taken with the S20+ look considerably better than my S10. The details are clearer with less smudging and images are sharper overall.", "But one area that the Samsung S20 lineup stands head and shoulders above the competition is the ability to record 8K video. You have to understand that while most phones can record 4K video to some extent, Samsung S20+ can record four times the number of pixels when shooting 8K video. This allows you to crop and edit videos without sacrificing quality. But with the technology being so new, you are limited to only 24fps and Samsung\u2019s advanced stabilisation tech\u2060\u2014Super Steady\u2060\u2014does not work with 8K recording (that is only available in 1080p recording). ", "With bleeding edge recording features available, the Korean company has equipped the S20+ with its latest Exynos 990. The octa-core processor combined with 8GB of RAM handles everything you throw at it, from playing demanding games to multitasking with ease. More game developers also are supporting high refresh rate screens like the one on the S20+. So I played Alto\u2019s Odyssey at 120Hz for an hour and I fell in love with the game all over again. The gameplay felt smoother than on my S10 and the phone remained cool as a cucumber. Battery life is also excellent on the S20+ thanks to the massive 4500mAh battery. I was browsing Reddit while YouTube played in the background (using a 3rd party app) and the phone just sipped power like an old lady drinking tea. Depending on your usage, you can easily expect the S20+ to last a full day on a full charge. The device also supports Super Fast charging and wireless charging.", "I nearly bit the bullet when the S20 and S20+ pre-booking notification popped up on my phone. The price along with the pre-booking offers seemed decent but my S10 is still rock solid and the few upgrades were not enough for me to switch though the new 120Hz screen is seriously making me consider switching. But for anyone else with older phones or thinking about leaving Apple\u2019s walled garden, the S20+ is an amazing piece of kit. I do miss the headphone jack but Samsung has you covered with their amazing Galaxy buds which I use far too much. The Samsung Galaxy S20+ has, in my opinion, one of the best displays in the market and the camera setup is inching ever so closer to DSLR quality.

Right from theatre fanatics to movie lovers, he managed to become an instant fan favourite with his movie Sano Sansar. On the contrary, Kundoon is a fresh face. Also an actor, his interest is in theatre and in music videos. ", "Sitting in the lobby of their family hotel, the brothers are discussing the rehearsal plans of the play they\u2019re supposed to work on together. So does Kundoon feel overshadowed by his older brother? \u201cNot really. It\u2019s actually worked to my advantage, having him in the same field. I get to broaden my contacts. But people have expectations from me since they know me as \u2018Karma\u2019s brother\u2019. That sometimes gets to me because I\u2019m afraid I may not be able to live up to that expectation,\u201d he says. ", "Even with 12 years between them, the brothers are more like friends. But what really is the best thing about having each other? Kundoon says, \u201cThe best thing about having him is being able to share things, especially clothes.\u201d Karma says he\u2019s cool with it \u201cbut sometimes I get annoyed because he wears a shirt I\u2019ve been saving for a special event.\u201d Aside from being a supplementing closet, Kundoon says that his older brother serves a higher purpose in his life\u2014that of being a protective figure with similar interest in books, movies, music, and art. \u201cHe\u2019s always there for me. Even when I was a kid, he used to take me to rehearsals and his shoots,\u201d he says. ", "Ambivalence about our siblings is inevitable. But, as long as the balance between the love and the hate of them is at least 60/40, we can live with it. In the case of the Shakya brothers, the balance is a whopping 99/1, right from day one. \u201cWhen he was born, I was in a boarding school in Darjeeling. I had no idea that my mother was expecting. So when I came home for vacation and saw her holding him, I was quite surprised,\u201d says Karma, remembering the winter of 1998. \u201cBut the moment I met him, I fell in love with him. Since then, I\u2019ve been taking care of him as his third parent.\u201d ", "Despite spending their childhood days in boarding schools, they never felt distant. \u201cWe\u2019d be together during vacations and most of our fond memories are from those days,\u201d says Karma. \u201cBut I think our bond is closer than ever at present. We\u2019ve done two plays together and that has played some part in it too. Conversations at the dinner table are easier now as we talk about our plans, not just among ourselves but with our parents as well,\u201d says Kundoon.", "For the dynamic duo that they are, they are each other\u2019s biggest fans. \u201cI admire his traveling spirit\u2014unplanned trips, hiking, and trekking,\u201d says Kundoon. Karma loves Kundoon\u2019s zest to learn new things. \u201cAlso, I\u2019m really glad he has developed a habit of reading,\u201d Karma says. \u201cI\u2019ve finished three books this month,\u201d says the excited Kundoon. Turns out Kundoon lost his phone and has time on his hands now. \u201cHe\u2019s using my old phone,\u201d says Karma. The banter ends with Kundoon elaborating on his plans to buy a new phone with his own money. And, does the plan include him signing movies? \u201cI\u2019m not into movies. For now, I\u2019m sticking to theatre and music videos. They\u2019re short and one can play with a lot of elements. And, I can always save up for a new phone,\u201d he says. ", "\u201cHad I not done theatre with dai for the first time and had instead done a movie, my life would\u2019ve been completely different. Theatre taught me to be humble,\u201d says Kundoon. The beaming older brother says, \u201cHumility is what takes you far not in just this line of work but in any given career. I don\u2019t mind asking him to work in our hotel. We wait on tables, do the dishes, and drive our guests to and from the airport.

The Nikon D5300 is one you might opt for, considering how functional, convenient and capable of delivering beautiful shots, the camera is. The main difference in favour of the D5300, from the early and late models, is the aggressive modes of automatic features, as it erects a flash with a ghostly hint of the need for triggering and self-raises ISO and exposure. Energy efficiency and battery life of the camera is just as good. This is a good camera for amateur photographers, as it will shoot 700 frames without trouble and will not drain the battery completely. It also boasts one of the best autofocus systems in its class and has excellent pixel density.", "If you don\u2019t want to go for traditional brands, you could opt for Sony. One of their popular models is the Sony ILCA-68, which has a number of features taken from more expensive models. Many argue this is a simplified version of the semi-professional model ILCA-77M2. It probably has the best autofocus system of all the above mentioned cameras. The 79-point phase AF module works clearly, quickly and steadily in all conditions. What more does an amateur photographer need?", "The fact that the camera offers a face detection system, which focuses on the eyes, adds convenience while taking portraits. A monochrome display on the top panel is an additional advantage. But there are a few drawbacks too, as it can only shoot 5 frames per second when it comes to serial shooting in full resolution. That said the image quality is amazing. This camera confidently shoots on ISO to 1600 units.", "The Canon EOS M50 is probably the camera to get if you are getting into photography.

Users went into a fury around notches during the earlier days of bezel-less displays, imagine what kind of a response an intrusive centre crease is going to prompt. While companies have been trying to reduce the visibility of creases, none of them have been successful. No matter how dim the crease may be, they\u2019re going to pop-out like a sore-thumb on dark and bright screens. ", "Another major problem around folding screens is the folding mechanism. Since the screens can\u2019t fold flush and they require at least a little bit of flex on stress points, this pushes folding mechanisms to make space for the screen to fold inside, or outside, the mechanism itself. In many instances of these mechanisms, they open up spaces of dirt, grime and small particles to make their way inside the folding mechanism. In ", " (on YouTube) on the Razr, a pebble lodged itself behind the folding screen due to the way it folded, leaving open spaces around the hinges when it did. Samsung, in the Z Fold, tried to mitigate this issue by placing bristles around the folding mechanism to catch dust particles, but in a ", " (again, on YouTube) that put these bristles to the test, they found it almost useless in keeping dust out of fine moving gears.", "Owning a phone with the ability to open and close also comes with their fair share of problems that traditional slab phones might have already engineered out. Foldable phones can\u2019t be water resistant since the folding mechanisms will always leave gaps through which water can find its way in. Screens will also not feel as premium as your slab phones, since folding glass has its own share of engineering complexities; although the Z Flip does feature a foldable glass display, many issues like visible glass shards still plague them. Even in the Z Flip, however, a plastic protection layer sits on top of the glass which mitigates many of the benefits of glass like scratch resistance and hardness.", "As exciting as foldable phones might be right now, they are far too young in terms of engineering to be of any use right now. ", " because of the fragility of wafer-thin parts and thin-foldable glass implements. Moving away from tried and tested designs will always come with unprecedented issues and right now, these foldable phones have many implementation, durability and engineering issues that need resolution.

{"title": "Poco X2: A worthy addition to the Poco family", "content": ["Xiaomi made a splash back in 2018 with their micro-brand Pocophone. The Pocophone F1, released mid-2018, was a phone that everyone wanted. It featured powerful hardware, a modern aesthetic and came at an affordable price point. The device was a hit in India and even in Nepal, many Nepali consumers bought the device through Daraz\u2019s exclusive online release. For Xiaomi and Poco, the F1 was a huge success becoming one of Xiaomi\u2019s best selling phones with 700,000 units sold by the end of 2018. Part of the success of the brand was also because it catered to consumer needs by undercutting their competitors\u2014similar devices with a Snapdragon 845 processor went to more than double the price of the F1.", "Even the after-market support of the F1 has been phenomenal. Poco has released timely upgrades reflected with an Android 10 upgrade from their initial Android 8.0 at the time of release. Considering just how beloved the Poco brand has been for mid- to low-range consumers, Poco fans have been awaiting the release of the predecessor to the F1, the F2 for years. And while Poco still hasn\u2019t followed up on their flagship device, they recently released a mid-ranged device that still undercuts their competitors and offers specifications that, in some cases, even blow their flagship out of the water. ", "Dubbed the Poco X2, the device was officially launched in India mid-February of this year. The brand-new device features recent hardware like the Snapdragon 730G chipset, which although not as powerful as Snapdragon\u2019s higher-end 800 series, is a very reliable and competent mid-ranged chip. Since the 730G is a mid-ranged processor, it is extremely efficient which means that it\u2019s going to use far less power than the more power-hungry processors of the 800 series. The 730G is an octa-core processor with CPU clusters, six efficient 1.8 Ghz cores and two powerful 2.2 Ghz Kyro 470 cores. Paired with the very competent Adreno 618 GPU, the phone is more than capable of handling graphic-intensive workloads easily. The base variant also comes with ample 6GB of RAM with the most expensive variant offering 8GB.", "The X2 offers similar specifications to the F1 except the high-performing CPU core, but regardless of the chipset specifications, the X2 also offers peripheral features that are lacking on the F1. The X2 offers an amazingly fast 120Hz display, is equipped to handle 27W of fast charging and has an insane 64MP Sony IMX686 camera sensor with an additional four cameras to support smartphone photography. Powering all of this is a massive 4,500 mAh battery. ", "Okay, the Poco X2 definitely looks good on paper, but what about physical aesthetics and usability? The Poco F1 too suffered from build-quality issues that many consumers looked past because of the low-price point. While the Poco F1 featured a subdued design that didn\u2019t really draw much attention, the X2 is flashy. Gone is the flimsy, cheap looking plastic build of the F1. The X2 is all metal, plastic and glass. A plastic mid-frame is sandwiched between two Gorilla Glass 5 panels that not only provide improved scratch resistance but also contributes to the structural integrity of the phone. The curved-edges helps the ergonomics of the phone since it tapers inside the corners of your palm, providing a confident grip even though the slippery glass back is a cause for concern here.", "Poco is branding the X2 as a phone for gamers. And in many ways, it delivers exceptional gaming performance. The 120Hz display comes in handy during gameplay since gamers will have that slight edge of faster response times. A faster display is not something that even many higher-end phones offer, so the fast screen is a much-appreciated addition to the X2. For long gaming sessions, the X2 comes with a well-implemented liquid-cooling system that keeps heat-levels of the 730G at bay, but even with good cooling, the phone gets quite warm when the phone is pushed hard. The 730G is definitely not as capable as the processor on the F1, but Snapdragon has specifically built the 730G with gaming in mind, so even with a mid-ranged processor you can expect a fluid gaming experience across all kinds of games. ", "For a gaming phone, the X2 has some really interesting optics. The 64MP sensor acts as the main camera supported by a 8MP wide-angle. Furthering the capabilities of these two cameras are two additional 2MP sensors, one detecting depth and one detecting macro focus. These optics, when paired with Xiaomi\u2019s Camera AI, produce some of the most vibrant and colourful photos when compared to other devices in this price-range. The additional wide-angle also comes as a welcome addition since the F1 didn\u2019t come with any wide-angle support. Night mode, however, is still hit-or-miss with the camera producing some beautiful shots at night to unusably grainy and saturated photos.", "Overall, the X2 is another great phone by Poco. It\u2019s cheaper than the F1 and adds some really neat new features and compromises on very little. Xiaomi\u2019s MIUI, its operating system, still remains a cause of concern for many, because of it\u2019s heavy skinning and resource consumption, but as a package, the X2 comes as a welcome addition to Poco\u2019s increasing line up of competitive phones. The Poco has already been released in India for INR 15,999 for the base-model and INR 19,999 for the decked-out version. Since the phone has just been released, it might take a while for the X2 to make its way into Nepali markets but once it does, it\u2019s a phone that Nepali consumers should definitely keep a close eye on because of the device\u2019s sheer price-to-performance ratio.\u00a0"], "author": "Prajesh SJB Rana", "article_published_date": "", "article_updated_date": "Kathmandu "},

A major impediment for this is the deeply rooted culture of impunity at the decision-making level. Similarly, a lack of credible leadership in transitional justice commissions has further cemented uncertainty. The transitional justice process in South Africa, though not without flaws, was concluded thanks to the leadership of Desmond Tutu. Garnering the trust of victims and the warring parties is quintessential. And that is what is largely missing in our case.

The commissions had in the past, too, functioned without proper law in place, and the situation hasn\u2019t changed even now. It would be wrong to expect anything concrete from the present leadership.", "What\u2019s more, the government and political leadership lack the clarity required to conclude the transitional justice process. Decisions are largely taken on an ad hoc basis. From conflict victims to security forces, civil society and the international community, there are many concerned parties.

Transitional justice is all about building confidence and ownership of the stakeholders. And consultation is the only way to gain it.", "That\u2019s the most unfortunate part of the transitional justice process. It would be prudent to revise the Enforced Disappeared Enquiry and Truth and Reconciliation Commission Act 2014 after holding wide deliberations with the concerned individuals. But the same mistake has been repeated. There was neither deliberation nor transparency when it came to appointing new members. The Act, too, has not been amended yet. There was no introspection on the failure of the previous commission officials. The consultations held in the name of collecting feedback for amendment were mere bogus attempts to show that the government talked to stakeholders before the amendment. It seems the only aim of the political leadership is to ensure all charges against them are quashed. ", "A few political elites are taking every decision without bringing the stakeholders on board.

But I now hear the same people are demanding that the similar system be in place so that victims and other concerned individuals have a place to voice their opinion. Had such a mechanism been in place before, it would have worked as a bridge between the government, transitional justice commissions and other stakeholders, including the international communities.

There is marginal productivity in agriculture. If the government is ready to modernise agriculture, then there are options to employ more people. Hundreds of thousands of hectares of land are currently barren because there are not enough people to cultivate them. A local government in Gulmi is encouraging people to engage in farming during the lockdown by offering cash subsidies for every ropani of cultivated land. ", "We will need agricultural tools worth billions of rupees, but migrant workers are unlikely to invest in these tools. Is the government ready to help? The government needs to ensure agricultural input, along with a market for products and access to roads and electricity. For this, the agriculture budget needs to be substantially increased. ", "Another area where employment can be generated is in river embankment projects. By employing engineers, local governments can participate in building embankments. Jobs can also be created in building infrastructure like roads, electricity distribution networks, water pipelines, telephone wires and sewage facilities. They should be developed under a single package. This could create a large number of jobs, possibly 300,000-400,000, at the local and provincial levels. ", "The country\u2019s foreign exchange earnings from remittance, exports, tourism and foreign aid are all going to be affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. I had thought that there might be more aid from multilateral donors but I am no longer confident that their support will grow substantially as there is now more competition for their resources. ", "Given this context, the government needs to re-prioritise the use of foreign exchange. The focus should be on procuring medical supplies, food items and capital goods. If there is extreme pressure, the government needs to be ready to impose a quota on the availability of foreign exchange. ", "I used to advocate big budgets and big infrastructure projects. But our capacity for expenditure is very limited. The Parliamentary Finance Committee has asked the government to introduce a budget of Rs1.7 trillion, but I don\u2019t believe the government will be able to spend that amount either. As we will not be working well until Tihar, we should not go for an ambitious budget. If we can achieve four percent growth next year and maintain inflation at seven percent, I will be happy.", "The government says that 18 percent of the population is below the poverty line. Due to the lockdown in the last two months, I predict that that population has now increased to 20-21 percent, as many people have lost jobs in the last two months. In order to help them, the government must remodel the Prime Minister\u2019s Employment Programme in line with India\u2019s Mahatma Gandhi Rural Employment Guarantee Programme, which is a very transparent programme. ", "My recommendation is that provincial governments be allowed to implement any projects below Rs5 billion and local governments be allowed to implement projects below Rs1 billion. The budget should be allocated accordingly. At the same time, the spending capacity of provincial and local governments should also be strengthened because they don\u2019t have technical knowhow regarding feasibility study and project appraisals, for which the federal government can send technical staff or assign retired bureaucrats.", "Despite the lockdown, we will have to bring production into operation, along with distribution channels for goods that help in import substitution and promote exports. For this, proper health protocols should be in place. If the government does not believe in the private sector\u2019s distribution channels, the army or police can run these services. The security agencies can deliver raw materials to the factories and help bring finished products to the market. We should not suspend all economic activities completely. ", "I am sympathetic to the private sector. The government seeks to recover taxes in whatever way possible but when the private sector is facing hardship, the government is hesitant. Due to the limitation of resources, the government may not be able to help the private sector with cash, but it can extend the tax payment deadline, provide interest subsidies and guarantee bank loans through the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation. ", "Currently, corporate income tax for banks is 30 percent and 25 percent for other sectors. India has already decreased corporate tax to 20 percent. As we are trying to attract foreign direct investment, we need a more favourable tax regime and better infrastructure than India, which also has access to the sea. The government can reduce corporate tax to 22 percent."], "author": "Prithvi Man Shrestha", "article_published_date": "2020-05-24", "article_updated_date": "Updated at : May 24, 2020 11:52 "},

With in-house glam squads temporarily a thing of the past because of worldwide self-quarantine, just like us regular folks, celebrities have to take care of their own haircuts and dye jobs. And they're putting it all on social media for us to see. But is it really as easy to get bangs at home as the 30 seconds Instagram stories? What if it ends up being short? Will it look like a bowl cut?", "\u201cCutting one\u2019s bangs is relatively easy. Unlike other hairstyling though, it should be done when the hair is dry so you can know the exact length of the fringes because wet hair shrinks as it dries,\u201d says Poonam Tamang, Senior Stylist at Bliss by Sakil Kunwar. \u201cRemember to always cut your bangs at least one cm longer than your desired length so that you can go in use your scissors vertically to give it a more professional look,\u201d suggests Poonam.", "One of the most searched terms right now is \u201chow to cut your own hair\u201d. If you are considering cutting your own bangs and you have zero experience, you should probably take a second to think things over. Do you actually want bangs, or are you just really bored? And with fringes being the first haircut idea people get when they\u2019re bored (along with shaving off all the hair, of course), make sure you are a hundred percent in it to trim it. And if you really, truly can\u2019t wait to see a hairstylist, then fret not because Susma Tamang, Hairstylist, and Instructor at Veda Institute, is here to offer her expertise. \u201cIf you are new to fringes, it is best if you cut it in such a way that your bangs sit just above your eyebrows so it won\u2019t fall in your eyes and disturb your vision,\u201d says Susma.", "So, now that you\u2019re convinced you can learn how to cut your own bangs\u2014you just need the right tools, tons of patience, and an easy-to-follow tutorial. And that's where hairstylist Roshni Rana comes in. Though she recommends going to a professional to get bangs cut, she\u2019s fine with at-home bang trims, provided you follow directions and use a pair of legitimate cutting shears. \u201cBefore you sit down to cut your hair, do assemble all the materials you need,\u201d she says. And what are those? \u201cYou\u2019ll need a pair of sharp scissors, a comb, a mirror, and a few clips.\u201d Roshni was kind enough to break it down step by step for all the novices who are new at handling hairdressing.", "You need to locate where your bangs truly begin. Hold a comb flat on top of your head. Turn sideways towards the mirror so you can see where your head starts to round in the front. That is your starting point for your bang section.", "Using a comb, separate your bangs from the rest of your hair by making a triangle shape.", "Take the triangle and pull it straight out from your head in front of you. Your fingers should be generally where you want the final trimmed length to be. Start further down if you\u2019re unsure; you can always go back in, we have nothing but time.", "Keeping your bangs between your fingers, delicately flip the very ends of your bangs upwards. Then you go in at an angle with the scissors called the point cutting. You point with the scissors like a clock\u2019s hand pointing to seven and then lightly trim across.", "The hardest part is over and its time to let it shine. You can style your bangs using a hairdryer or a straightener. The best way is to curl your bangs from their roots to the tip in an arching motion to build volume.", "Here\u2019s hoping this cures at least a few hours of your self-isolation boredom because truth be told, you\u2019ve killed a few hours just thinking about cutting your own bangs. So should you attempt to ruin your hairdresser\u2019s handiwork while you\u2019re on your own?

I enjoy watching the world from the protagonist\u2019s point of view.\u201d This fondness urged her to start writing her own narration. \u201cIt felt like reading a diary and I wanted to have something like that.

They were also making banking robots while simultaneously working on making chatbots for various businesses to offer a quick solution to customer inquiries. ", "For this group of innovators, 2020 was a promising year. However, by the beginning of March, things started changing. As the number of Covid-19 cases rose, the government announced a nation-wide lockdown, which meant their company had some urgent rethinking to do.", "\u201cWe were starting to think about how we as a tech company could be part of a solution to mitigate the crisis the world was having,\u201d says Giri, who is also the head of robotics at Paaila Technology. By this point, global news was rife with the shortage of ventilators, an appliance for artificial respiration. There weren\u2019t enough ventilators for patients of Covid-19 and people were dying. In Italy, amid the outbreak of the virus, doctors were being made to choose which patients should get the machines to help them breathe.", "That was when Giri thought of creating ventilators.

The team worked closely with biomedical engineers and medical professionals day and night, and in 20 days, the company was ready with a prototype that weighed 25 kgs. It was a simple Ambu bag-based ventilator that could assist initial respiratory support to any patient with respiratory failure. It also had a USP support for power back up, and a monitoring screen that could give the graph readings to doctors besides buttons that could control inspiratory: expiratory ratio, respiratory rate, minute volume and pressure limitations.

A team of anesthesiologists from Dhulikhel Hospital, in a report, also acknowledged appreciation for their hard work and have also been working with the team to improve and upgrade the ventilators. At Dhulikhel, their ventilator was also tested against the standard ventilators to check the device\u2019s calibration, accuracy and parameter.", "\u201cFor the certification process from the Ministry of Health, we have tested our devices in a trauma centre. The centre has given us some feedback, and we are currently working on that. Once that is done, we can help Covid-19 patients,\u201d says Shrestha.

So, I think our ventilators can be very useful,\u201d says Binay Raut, CEO and co-founder of Paaila Technology.

{"title": "Covid-19: A scientific perspective", "content": ["Ever since the first case of the novel coronavirus (subsequently renamed SARS-CoV-2) in humans was reported by authorities in China, its spread has been continuous. Beginning in Wuhan, then moving to parts of Italy before spreading to the rest of Europe, then spreading to the United States (now the hotspot), Covid-19 has become the next big pandemic after the 2009 outbreak of the Swine flu (novel influenza A/H1N1). Interestingly, high-income countries appear to have been the most affected by this pandemic. Europe and the US account of 70 percent of total deaths caused by Covid-19 to date. An accurate number of the infected is hard to calculate, since not all countries are testing their population the same way and in the same numbers. But Africa and Asia (including China) have reported less than 10 percent of global deaths. Cases in India are increasing, but the mortality numbers are much lower than in high-income countries. South America also has not been as severely affected, with just over 5 percent of global mortality. In the South Asian region, Covid-19 cases are on an increasing trend. Yet, for a region with very high population density, further aggravated by low economic status, the severity of the disease, and the death rate, so far appear low.", "Nepal reported its first Covid-19 case in January this year and the second case was reported after two months, in March. New cases have been detected regularly since the number of diagnostic tests increased somewhat from March. Yet, the point of interest is the marked absence of severe cases. To date, only two people in Nepal have succumbed to the disease. If we are to follow the global statistics, up to 20 percent of the infected population (in the higher age group and those with other co-morbidities) should have severe symptoms. Even if we assume that there are many more Covid-19 cases in Nepal that have escaped detection due to a lack of enough testing, the current situation\u2014of the low number of severe cases\u2014makes us wonder why. Well-planned research is the way forward, and for that, the government needs to work closely with like-minded and knowledgeable individuals. There are some theories that might help guide our research.", "Nepal has a relatively young population. According to national census data from 2011, the median age is approximately 22 years, with 95 percent population under the age of 65. Global data for Covid-19 has shown that people over 70 years are affected much more than those younger. In Nepal, the percentage of the population over the age of 70 is 3 percent and those over 80, around 0.8 percent. Compare this to Italy, where the median age is 46 years, with over 20 percent of the population aged 65 or over, and it might show why they were hit hard by the pandemic. Further, there is scientific literature that suggests BCG vaccination may play a role in reducing the severity of infections in populations that have this vaccine in their routine immunisation programmes. While outliers exist, the data supporting this observation is substantial. Nepal (and many other developing countries) has been implementing this vaccine for preventing tuberculosis for about 50 years. Furthermore, exposure to various pathogens when young has been linked to strengthened immunity. Could this be a factor for reduced severity in the Nepali population? Lastly, the novel coronavirus, like many other viruses, mutates regularly. The question arises whether the virus strain floating around the country has undergone a mutation, allowing it to stay within the body for a long time but without causing severe symptoms like what has been seen in affected countries.", "Nepal\u2019s response measures are a much-discussed topic on social media. One group thinks that we have yet to see the true impact of the virus, as it is just emerging in India from where it will trickle into Nepali districts. An opposing thought is that since it\u2019s been over six months since the start of the pandemic, and Nepal well-connected with China and India, the infection could have been in the population for a very long time and we may be identifying the later stages of a pandemic. Both of these ideas make sense, depending on how one looks at the situation. Regardless, the dilemma the Nepal government faces is how to move forward.", "The World Health Organisation has outlined requirements to ease the lockdowns in countries. However, to attain those requirements, it would take months, if not years. Therefore, each country has to make its own assessment so that its population is least affected. The same solution will not fit all regions. The need for a catered response is all the more true for low-income countries. Pakistan and India, two of the most populated countries in South Asia, have seen a sharp increase in Covid-19 cases and mortality in the last few weeks, but have started easing lockdown restrictions. In fact, Pakistan has eased the lockdown in a major way while cases continue to rise. Nepal has also eased restrictions somewhat, yet those appear only on paper and not observed in implementation with complete lack of clarity. There appears to be a misunderstanding in the population as well as within the government that lockdowns alone will solve the problem of Covid-19. This couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. The lockdown is just a temporary solution. If implemented strictly for a long time, lockdown will only lead to other, more serious issues in the population. ", "There has been a sharp rise in cases of suicide around the country during the lockdown. Violence (sexual and otherwise) against women is on the rise. Mental health cases have been reported to be on the rise, too. Five districts recently reported an outbreak of measles, while the national immunisation programme has been severely affected. The season for vector-borne and food or water-borne diseases is upon us, yet health services are focused solely on Covid-19. Dengue, scrub typhus, and diarrheal diseases are endemic to Nepal, and are likely to cause death in the vulnerable population in the absence of services. Maternal mortality at childbirth, especially during home births, in remote parts of Nepal is likely to increase due to lockdown. Similarly, lifesaving medications for major non-communicable diseases such as diabetes, kidney diseases, cancer among others are already hard to access for the majority of the population in Nepal, as lockdown affects transport and health services. Covid-19 is capable of causing death, but a long term lockdown will lead to far more death and disability in the Nepali population. ", "We need to accept that Covid-19 will continue, both globally as well as in Nepal, for a long time. We need to continue to monitor the situation, carry on with contact tracing, maintain strict health measures while at the same time gradually easing off lockdown measures. We have to ultimately face the virus, learn to live with it, while taking special precautions for the elderly, those with other diseases and pregnant women.

Failing at which, she slides into instant depression. This is just the beginning of how Polish author Dorota Mas\u0142owska\u2019s novel \u2018Honey, I Killed the Cats\u2019 shreds the vapid millennial culture that is filled with advertisements, commodities, and shallow relationships. ", "The author revels in uprooting this millennial hope of \u2018balancing our chakras\u2019 through kale juices and Pilates while our mental health is ripping apart seam to seam. She mocks the intense food deprivations we go through the entire week, only to binge eat our feelings and fears come weekend. ", "She throws shade at newfound Buddhists; just-turned vegans; coffee addicts; sartorial choices; those who don\u2019t have \u2018five million friends on Facebook.\u2019 The novel is a quirky observation, ruthless critique and clever parody of the world within and around us. ", "In this world, Fah is a character millennials dread turning into: someone who receives no mail, except for breast enlargement (and brain reduction), is at the outcast fringes of social media; is shunned by users of dating sites. Her only distraction is a plethora of sexual dreams starring long-forgotten boyfriends and distant acquaintances. ", "To this distressed germaphobe Fah, who sneaks out antibacterial gel at every opportunity, Joanne is the antipode. Soon after, Joanne, who \u201cwore greasy, flag-red lipstick, ironed her hair straight, so that it looked fake, and every morning, first smearing her legs in moisturizer until they shined like glass, she would run a pencil straight up to her butt, so that under the appropriate shade of stockings it would look like a seam\u201d, becomes Fah\u2019s best friend.", "Mas\u0142owska\u2019s piercing gaze takes in everything, from the exterior scuffles and snarls to the \u2018mounds of loneliness\u2019 in her characters. And then she replicates these personas and emotions on paper. But not in ordinary words. The descriptions that pour out of her are so extraordinary and compelling; irreverent and wild; laughable and shocking that they hold the entire book together. The plot is there, somewhere, lost within the wilting power and scathing beauty of this detailing. ", "For example, a person\u2019s teeth in the September sunshine \u2018like the keyboard of some expensive instrument.\u2019 The colour of someone\u2019s hair is \u2018artificial chestnut lacquered to the point of perfect imperviousness to the most severe weather conditions.\u2019 ", "Heels are \u2018plucked off and decentered like they were cross-eyed\u2019; someone smells \u2018like a goat that\u2019s just brushed its teeth\u2019; another person is a \u2018hard-pickled ham pimped out with legs\u2019; a jacket becomes a \u2018little fry-scented cloud;\u2019 a cigarette spins to the ground like \u2018like an itty-bitty burning ballerina, or a \u2018shard of a Christmas star smashed by hoodlums.\u2019 ", "All these astounding similes make for an enjoyable and imaginative read. Even more arresting is more drawn-out images, tapping into the soul of a person and the character of a place. This description of the city at dusk, for example, is careless, indifferent even, and yet so accurate and tender: \u201cThe evening city was seething in its basin-like black soup garnished with glass and light, bubbling over with secrets and excess; dogs barked, the subway wailed, someone who\u2019d been raped on had merely had her handbag snatched was screaming horribly in the distance, and artificial fires flared into the darkness over the river, promising that, still, anything could happen.\u2019", "This sense of marvel and curiosity for the coming moment, an uncertainty that permeates the characters\u2019 action and the world they inhabit, is built a little higher in every page. Everything is an experiment in the absurd\u2014reckless and rambunctious. The work mocks the seriousness with which we take ourselves as we continue to destroy the ecology and social structures and our very bodies that were meant to revel in this. And suddenly we are transferred to a surreal world where mermaids long to be humans, decorating themselves with human waste, that makes us want to hide ourselves in shame. ", "This admonishing and chastising is barely solid or directly accusatory, it is like vapour, a quickly flowing liquid that never settles and is difficult to define or contain. This makes the novel itself so wispy you would fail to describe to another just what it was about or what it means. You read and laugh and struggle to understand the inside jokes that are funny and frightening. And somehow the spool of plot unravels and scuttles away, never to be found again. So you reread and forget, flip back and comprehend the contempt the words emit even better the second time around, and so on.", "The slim novel is a parody of our times, and yet it is also the revelation of every truth that we would like to hide. It unearths the fa\u00e7ade erected of yoga pants and healthy diets; social media influencing and soul-finding trips. It sees beyond the attempt at collective humor and memes to bandage our loneliness and depression. Nowhere is this farce as clear as it is during an absurd art exhibition. A newly-introduced character advising Fah on art is hilarious because it is so true, \u201cTake a couple of dirty Q-tips and use an Ikea pencil to draw a dick.\u201d ", "And in making this intense work of art available to the English-speaking public much thanks must be given to the translator, Benjamin Paloff.

Ajay Devgn\u2019s new film Tanhaji: The unsung warrior continues in that same tradition.", "Tanhaji Malusare (Devgn) was a real-life general in the court of 17th century Maratha emperor Chhatrapati Sivaji Maharaj (Sharad Kelkar). He is sort of like the Kalu Pandey to Prithivi Narayan Shah, and in the same way that Nepali textbooks describe Pandey, the film presents Tanhaji\u2014the brave and good guy who battles against the odds. He is a religious devotee, a selfless warrior, a master of disguise, a loving husband, an honest patriot and skilled in guerrilla warfare. He is also a dear friend to the Maratha emperor. ", "Elsewhere, the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb (Luke Kenny) rules over North India. Aurangzeb is portrayed here as evil, and that\u2019s pretty much his only identity. He is so demented that he plays chess with actual humans, who must fight to the death. This evil emperor wants to expand his empire to South India and, to further his plans, he seizes a hilltop-fortress called Kondhana in Maratha territory. ", "Aurangzeb now sends his mightiest warrior, the sadistic Udaybhan Singh Rathore (Saif Ali Khan) to protect Kondhana. And if you thought Aurangzeb was bad, Udaybhan is worse. He takes pleasure in taunting and torturing prisoners, mercilessly beats his enemies with blunt objects, scalds people to death, roasts endangered species, and kidnaps a widow to watch her bathe. Basically, he\u2019s supposed to be the stark opposite of all that Tanhaji is. ", "News travels fast to the Marathas that Udaybhan is travelling to Kondhana. He\u2019s travelling with Naagin, the mightiest cannon in existence (read: a huge phallic object). If the cannon fires from Kondhana, the Maratha emperor and all his people will be obliterated. Sivaji now has to reconquer Kondhana at all costs, and the only man for the job is Tanhaji Malusare. ", "In terms of story, that\u2019s all there is to it. We follow a battle of strategy and physical prowess between the good Tanhaji and the bad Udaybhan. The film is told through the Maratha perspective, equipped with extreme nationalism and all the clich\u00e9 tropes of the genre. Does the hero\u2019s best friend, or an important character, die a glorious death (usually in slow motion)? Yes. Does the strongest keep on fighting even as he is riddled with arrows? Obviously. And, before all the fighting, can you expect a rousing speech on the importance of motherland, sacrifice for the common good, one\u2019s people, culture, and sovereignty? Take a guess. ", "The film is written by Prakash Kapadia and Om Raut, who is also the director. And the filmmakers insist on inserting religious politics into their film. In hindsight, this seems rather unnecessary because the film is about territory. Once the Muslim enemy is defeated, the film cuts to a temple with a celebratory bell ringing. They even use Hindu gods as a war cry. There are only two songs in the film, \u2018Maai Vabhawani\u2019 and \u2018Shankara\u2019 and both are about Hindu deities.

The film\u2019s visuals, sound design, costumes, and location visual effects are masterful. They\u2019re as good as any international historical epic, like 300, Game of Thrones or even Baahubali.

I was especially impressed with the background score that amplifies the action, right from the opening sequence.", "Cinematographer Keiko Nakahara\u2019s clean framing allows you to follow everything without questioning anything. Nakahara especially chooses to stay wide often and employs long takes during fight scenes. This allows you to notice the intricate choreography and marvel at the lengths the actors have gone taken.", "But ultimately, the film is all about the machismo of two male characters.

Mothers don\u2019t have dreams, Jaya argues, adding that pursuing her dreams would make her a selfish mother, a cruel one. ", "Kangana carries the film and she does so effortlessly. There is a scene in the film when Meenu tells her someone in her kabbadi team that they should learn sportsmanship from Jaya. This instance resonates for Kangana, the actor, too. Although the film is out and out based on Kangana\u2019s character, she never lets her celebrity overshadow. It never feels forced or big in the way Bollywood treats its leads. Her presence is subtle but impactful. In fact her best scenes are those which she performs without even saying a word.

However, the makers don\u2019t do justice to all of them. Neena Gupta is one of these actors. Gupta plays Jaya\u2019s mother, and she doesn\u2019t have much to do. She just hops in and out of the film at convenience, although there is one telephone scene that feels like a tribute to the bond all mothers and daughters share.

But his constant smile can get a little redundant and unnerving at times. It\u2019s as if smiling is his default. Another actor, Richa Chadda, looks and performs her part with such ease, it\u2019s just brilliant. She brings the most joy in the film. Her character doesn\u2019t have an arc, but in the film she stands for all the women who, regardless of their personal and professional achievements, are reminded time and again that their worth is tied to their womb. It\u2019s quite refreshing to see female characters support and strengthen each other.", "It\u2019s important to mention reiterate the fact Tiwari is the director of the film\u2014she\u2019s a woman telling a woman\u2019s story. Tiwari manages to beautifully capture the guilt a wife and a mother inevitably feel if she dares to prioritise herself, and her dreams. And she does this ever so subtly.", "She also manages to bring in small details of the middle-class life, through her characters and her set\u2014right from the kitchen utensils to the netted doors, and the way the clothes are hung on the front porch.

Archaic censorship laws meant that the audiences were expected to use their imaginations, like if actors thrust their gyrating hips to lewd lyrics, we understood the metaphor. ", "Things didn\u2019t change much in the 21st century. But now came audience-friendly sex scenes. Sweaty actors mock kissed each other\u2019s necks, and moaned (always in songs) with their eyes shut. Slowly entered the sex comedies, but these were mostly without any thought or plot featuring perverts who talk in lewd double entendres, objectified women, and got in trouble, all because they want to get laid.", "But slowly there seems to a slight shift in the way sex is dealt with in Bollywood. Issue-based sex comedies are being given serious thought and are well written. Sex is no longer the most scandalous thing but rather an everyday reality. ", " (2012), ", "(2017), and ", " (2018) proved that you can make a film with sex in the epicentre and still be mature about everything. There are sex jokes in these films, but none of them are indecent. The double entendres here are situational. The actors talk about sex, but somehow, and yet, more often than not, you can watch these films with your parents, and not cringe. The latest film, ", " falls in this spectrum. ", "Varun Batra (Akshay Kumar) and Deepti Batra (Kareena Kapoor Khan) regard sex as a means to bear a child. They haven\u2019t tried to conceive for the last seven years of their marriage. Now Deepti believes that time is running out. And, the mandatory pressure from friends and family to conceive doesn\u2019t help her cause either. Varun, however, hasn\u2019t really come to terms with being a father, but he agrees to everything Deepti asks him to do. The film begins with Deepti declaring that she is ovulating, and Varun races (literally in a cycle) to her. ", "Deepti and Varun are portrayed as sophisticated couples, who have done their internet research on positions during and after sex that help conceive. Most of the jokes in the first fifteen minutes are based on this situation. Sex isn\u2019t ever shown in the film, instead it\u2019s comically implied. Sex for this couple is a job. Even after trying their best, Deepti and Varun can\u2019t conceive. So, they ask doctors Anand Joshi (Adil Hussain) and Sandhya Joshi (Tisca Chopra) for help. Their doctors suggest a very potent in vitro fertilisation (IVF), and Deepti and Varun agree. ", "In the same hospital, we meet another couple. Honey Batra (Diljit Dosanjh) and Monika Batra (Kiara Advani). They are emotional, very reactive, and struggle with the English language. They seem nothing like the sophisticated Batras, but they share the same problems. They too haven\u2019t been able to conceive, and have also agreed to IVF, to be performed by the same doctors. ", "Things get messed up when doctors Anand and Sandhya apologise to the two Batra couples for a terrible mistake. They confess that the sperm samples from Honey and Varun were switched in the laboratory, because of their similar surnames. Now, Deepti is pregnant with Honey\u2019s sperm, and Monika is pregnant with Varun\u2019s. Now, abortion they\u2019re told is a bad idea because of health conditions, and both couples have to live with the gross negligence. This is where the film breaks for interval. ", "There isn\u2019t much to the story after that and the film relies on the strongly written characters\u2014it\u2019s four leads. And, the actors who play these characters are easily the high point of the film. The lead, Akshay Kumar is a delight to watch. His portrayal of Varun as a mean, selfish orthodox man, who lives in the ideologies of the 90s, but is learning the ways of the new millennium is a delight to watch. Kumar\u2019s casting feels on point, also because he\u2019s playing very close to his age. His wife Deepti, played by Kareena is also equally good. Deepti is the stark opposite of Varun. She is controlling and demanding, and although they might not sound like an ideal couple, these actors and their performances will make you believe that the two perfectly complement each other. ", "Honey and Monika are written as the Punjabi stereotypes. They are everything a Punjabi song is\u2014loud, flashy, blunt, but jolly. This could have been a catastrophe in the hands of incapable actors because both Honey and Monica are written as very conventional characters. However, because of the fabulous performances of Advani and Dosanjh, the audiences see beyond the exterior Punjabi stereotypes.", "The film is written by Jyoti Kapoor, Rishabh Sharma (dialogues), and Raj Mehta (director). The writing for the first half is brisk, and filled with sharp humour. But through the second half, the film starts feeling formulaic and stretchy. And that\u2019s mostly because all the emotional and melodramatic moments are reserved for the second half. However, the humour aspect is maintained throughout and it saves the film.", "The writing, however, isn\u2019t without flaws. For example, the writers seem to be a little too invested in the idea of lineage. Two major characters in two different instances are saying things like, \u2018The obsession to pass on your genes is a very deep one\u2019 and, \u2018", "\u2019 (In the end, own blood is what matters, no?). These are statements by the doctor and Deepti respectively. But strangely the film doesn\u2019t carry these values and never even deals with the issue any more than the dialogues. The writers could have also definitely dealt better with the Punjabi stereotypes.", "In hindsight, it\u2019s as if the writers found one interesting idea and designed everything else around that one premise. However, in order to maintain their interesting premise, they stayed away from developing the story any further. Also, at times, the film focuses too much on culture and traditions, making it feel like this film isn\u2019t aware of the contemporary India. In their bid to maintain the dramatic twists in the plot, the film portrays a clear anti-abortion stance. Both the doctors, and Varun and Deepti discuss abortion, but they quickly shut down as soon as the topic comes up. Deepti doesn\u2019t want an abortion because, she says, \u201cWe can\u2019t be murderers.\u201d An accomplished celebrity, Kareena Kapoor Khan, calling abortion murder can\u2019t be the message contemporary India needs.", "All said and done, we must appreciate the film, first for its actors and second for bringing issues like this in the mainstream, and for treating the issue with respect.

The interpretation of these paintings, therefore, can be as free-flowing as the artist\u2019s strokes. ", "But it is difficult to comprehend Manandhar\u2019s choice in the number of paintings. If the exhibition represents eight ajimas, then what purpose do 13 paintings serve? As the artist does not want to give any input to the audience\u2019s interpretations, it is unclear whether he has repeated certain ajima\u2019s representations, or are the rest of the five paintings about the five Newar patron deities (Ganesh, Kumar Bhairav, Simhini and Vyagrihi), who dance along the eight matrikas at Patan every Dashain? This is yet another puzzle for the onlookers. ", "In abstract art, artists usually rely heavily on shapes, textures, lines, forms and even colours. This can be often overwhelming to the audience.

The intention was to portray her character as someone strong,\u201d says Paudel.", "However, it was not easy to make a movie with an unconventional story compared to the Nepali box office earners, even though the story was of many Nepali women.

Around 5 am, at the Hiranya Varna Mahavihar, a baha monastery that many know as the Golden Temple, a group of elders would sit down to chant the Namasangati Sutra Path, a Buddhist prayer. Others from the neighbourhood would light butter lamps. The prayers would go on all morning, with different groups coming in to read different Buddhist scriptures at different times.", "On most days, around 9 am, Kiran Shakya, a local of Nakabahil, Patan, would take his daily walk around the Mahavihar. But since the lockdown, he has stopped going. Life around and inside the bahas have changed. \u201cAn eerie silence now fills the air,\u201d he says. Nakabahil, a courtyard settlement that has about 250 houses, which was always full-of-life now is hushed. Besides the locals who live there, no strangers are allowed inside. ", "The Valley\u2019s bahas and bahis have been known to house close-knit, core Newa settlements. This traditional architectural setting is built on the foundational practice and proliferation of Buddhism through sanghas, members in Viharas, and the main monasteries. These monasteries are attached to different communal courtyards, linked through narrow alleyways, called Lacchi, which leads to other courtyards like kacabaha or nani or chuka. For example, the Golden Temple in Kwa Baha, the main Buddhist monastery is attached to Nagbaha and Ikkhachhen baha.", "While the Guthi system designates each family with responsibilities to uphold the tradition that has long been passed down from generation to generation, it is through the communities in these bahas and bahis that many cultural traditions continue. But as people are in close proximity to each other in this communal setting, many people are worried about the challenges of maintaining social distancing as Covid-19 cases increase in the country. ", "Where once homes around the bahas and bahis would have been hosting ", ", or gatherings during this time of the year in Patan, courtyards now are much quieter. Neighbours now wave at each other from terraces and converse from window to window rather than meeting at the patis. Close ones meet online via video chats than in person. And while the police enforce the lockdown outside, inside the bahas, local volunteers monitor the movement of people inside the courtyards. ", "At Nakabahil, even as children come out to play once in a while, or even if elders sit down in the phalchas for some relaxed times, locals make sure they are maintaining a safe social distance. Many prefer to buy groceries just from the local shop inside the baha itself. ", "\u201cI had not considered this before, but it\u2019s true that there is a possible risk of rampant spread in these courtyards if people are not careful. These are houses that live with extended families and where people are likely to take a stroll around the Chaityas or the nearby temples in the courtyards,\u201d says Mohan Pant, a resident of Bhaktapur and a teacher at Khwopa Engineering College. ", "\u201cPeople are likely to be intimidated with the idea of social distancing when your whole life you have immersed in a social setting, moreover tempted to breach the boundary these times have enforced,\u201d he says. Pant has also studied about the residential courtyard settlements of Patan to analyse the residential setting of the historic core of Patan. ", "\u201cThe physical structure of bahas encourages people to engage with the community. The open courtyard allows for social engagement: there are phalchas and patis for people to sit and talk, wells to draw water out from, temples and even the alleyways are interconnected binding lives of people together,\u201d he says. \u201cMany of these houses that are small in space also ask people to come out for open space itself,\u201d says Pant.", "Because of its structure, it is tough for people to stay isolated. At Te Baha, in Kathmandu, that houses the Sankata temple, the large courtyard echoes with cackles of laughter as children play badminton and basketball in the evenings. Occasionally the police come in to monitor the lockdown too, during this time, the community people stay indoors. \u201cBut in the morning and in the evening people are usually out in the big space we have; it\u2019s hard for people not to come outside,\u201d says Bishwo Bijaya Bajracharya, advisor of Sankata Club and a priest at the Sankata Temple. ", "\u201cIn a way, although the world outside of the baha is under a strict lockdown, here inside life still has a positive outlook. Some locals still move around the area but cautiously, of course\u201d he says.", "And with so much uncertainty regarding the virus, time and again, conflicts have spurred. \u201cThere was one person who had gone to Ramechaap and had come back a few weeks ago, and so many people were concerned, as they feared the person could be a carrier of the virus,\u201d says Ujwala Shakya, chair of Thyaka Misa Pucha. Soon after the person\u2019s arrival, the community people found themselves muddled with questions: how do you stop someone from entering their own house and what if the person is infected? ", "\u201cThese are tough times to be in and that is making us wary about each other especially as we live in a close-knit community and if the virus does enter the community, there is the risk of rampant spread,\u201d she says. The person was later allowed in but was asked to remain in quarantine for a few days. ", "Despite the challenges of maintaining social distancing while being under lockdown, these communities are also doing their bit to give back. The community of Te Baha has also taken this time to clean and upkeep the monuments in the area. \u201cWe have been taking this time to repair things around the area. We have already done some painting around the temple and the public space,\u201d says Bajracharya. The Sankata temple, however remains closed for the public and only the priests are allowed in for daily rituals. \u201cWe have volunteers monitoring social distance and checking people who are moving in and out,\u201d he adds. ", "Like Te Baha, many other bahas and bahis have also been coming up with their own programmes, many of which aim to be of help to the community. At Nakabahil, Thyaka Misa Puchha, in collaboration with Thyaka Sahakari with support from ward 16, organised a blood donation programme besides collecting money from the area to help families in the community that have been hit hard with the lockdown. Thyaka Sudhar Sangha, a local organisation in Patan, distributed about Rs 5,000 each to 20 families that they identified as living in a vulnerable situation during the lockdown. ", "Another committee, the Nakabahil Tol Bikash Samiti, has also been working to provide telemedical-counselling through doctors in their community. \u201cThe idea is to help people connect to the right medical help. It\u2019s not for health-check up but rather to help them find the right medical attention,\u201d says Kiran Shakya. For social and religious inter-exchange, many communities have also moved online for discussions and live prayer programmes on Facebook.", "\u201cIt\u2019s a stressful time for everyone, not just us. But I also believe it\u2019s time for the communities to help the people who need a hand to survive this crisis,\u201d says Shakya. \u201cWe do everything as a community, celebrating and engaging socially and religiously; we also need communal solidarity to get through this tough time,\u201d says Shakya.\u00a0"], "author": "Srizu Bajracharya", "article_published_date": "2020-05-29", "article_updated_date": "Lalitpur "},

A brilliant professional and devoted mother, her identity is far more and infinitely broader than the former First Lady.", "This, essentially, is what her autobiography \u2018Becoming\u2019 seeks to capture. In a history that\u2019s almost always male and sterile, victorious and megalomaniac, Michelle creates a welcome respite with her down-to-earth, humane, and relatable account. Even when it is examined as a public relations tool, the autobiography is surprisingly touching and uplifting. It is a story that deserves to be told, and listened to, and appreciated for the different voice and entirely dissimilar perspective from the norm. ", "The book\u2019s tone is set from the very first page \u2013 firm, intimate, and making quite an effort to be frank. Michelle acknowledges that being \u201cthe first lady of the United States of America\u201d is a \u201cjob that\u2019s not officially a job.\u201d But she does experience thoroughly the power and influence and hazards of the \u201cnon-job\u201d, and explains them as best as possible to a curious public.", "But this is not a tale of grandeur and show. Michelle\u2019s story is filled with personal and familial triumphs and tribulations\u2014relatable and sometimes inspiring. It is a great read for all women, that goes without saying, but especially for men, who find it easy to label women like Michelle (and many assertive go-getters) as \u201cangry\u201d and \u201cbossy.\u201d Michelle has grappled head-on with this title that women are so conveniently bestowed with, and she does it with aplomb and grace. The book is clever, smart and strategic, just like its title and the chapter names. \u201cOptics governed more or less everything in the political world,\u201d says Michelle, and this observation could also be true of this book\u2014for there is a constant striving for balance, diplomacy, and what looks \u201cgood and acceptable.\u201d ", "The roots of this story are more important and revealing: the streets Michelle grew up in, the family who cherished her, the sacrifices they made for her top-notch education. The inculcation of books and art, of the outdoors and music, of humour and sports, and most central to it all, family and lasting relationships, establish the theme that Michelle\u2019s life revolves around. ", "Anchoring her writing on the state of equality and inclusion in the United States, Michelle is clear of her stance on issues of racism, identity and body politics. This book is an excellent study on how deep and multi-pronged the roots of racism run. Not only did Michelle\u2019s grandmother have to sue a university for refusing her accommodation and suggesting she rent with the \u2018coloureds,\u2019 she experienced the ugly realities of racism in her own life\u2014when her brother\u2019s bicycle was confiscated by a policeman who reused to believe he hadn\u2019t stolen it; and a long, purposefully drawn gash appearing at the side of her father\u2019s car when they visit a white-dominated suburb. \u201cPolitics had traditionally been used against black folks, as a means to keep us isolated and excluded, leaving us undereducated, unemployed, and underpaid,\u201d she summarises succinctly the devastating consequences of institutionalised and internalised racism. ", "Along with her racial identity, Michelle constantly analyses her gender and its projection in relation to her husband. She expresses, so eloquently, the fear that grows in every other independent, married woman\u2014as the wife of a seemingly more successful man, she says, \u201cI was now Mrs Obama in a way that could feel diminishing, a missus defined by her mister.\u201d As she tries to navigate this murky territory, she also reveals the acute burden she feels as a female, the frustrations of raising children single-handedly, the rifts in her marriage, a poignant miscarriage, the rigors of couples counselling. It captures the beauty within the mundaneness of millions of other lives. ", "This attempt to be forthcoming while maintaining a distance is the autobiography\u2019s strength. Its weakness? It grows too long, sometimes cumbersome, and unnecessarily detailed. The material simply does not justify a volume of 400+ pages. Its second drawback is the constant, incessant, tone-deaf hero worship of Barack Obama. While Michelle shares a sentence or two about his difficult habits, the majority of the pages are devoted to upholding the image of the \u2018great, kind, one-in-a-billion president who needs to be worshipped\u2019\u2014which is a great thing, it\u2019s almost a marital contract to hype your spouse, but not to a point where it gets overdone and grates on the nerves.", "This, for example\u2014almost reverentially, Michelle reveals, \u201cBarack is the sort of a person who needs a hole, a closed-off little warren where he can read and write undisturbed.\u201d But don\u2019t we all? Yet which mother like Michelle, except the inordinately privileged, can reach a vacation villa and disappear into her \u2018warren\u2019, her \u2018hole\u2019, no matter how desperately she needs to write or think or merely relax? It is in these moments of trying to create the \u2018perfect\u2019 president that Michelle\u2019s work is at its most unconvincing. An indulgence in too much diplomacy and delicacy coats the work with an artificial veneer. ", "What does remain extremely convincing though is the adage, repeated on and off throughout the book, that it is possible, through sheer hard work and grit, for a person to change their lives and fortunes. It is also possible, even while being wife to the President, to come up with highly creative and innovative ideas that contribute to the self and society. It strongly advocates the necessity and positivity of diversity and inclusion in every possible sector and space, with practical examples that are both touching and disturbing. Most of all, what remains true and unchanged, something that can\u2019t ever be feigned, is the power of love and relationships, of family and community\u2014the universal thread that binds everyone from the president and his wife to the common public.

And their shadows follow everything, reflecting sometimes the polar opposite of portrayed reality and other times in support to the main character, his wife, during her pregnancy. The human figures are the central idea of Lama\u2019s works: they are him and his thoughts, and the visuals of his mind. And in them, motifs like sunflowers, fish (even dead ones), toilet systems, fish bowls are recurring objects and his metaphors for light, train of thoughts, escapism and boundaries.", "According to Lama, motifs have always been a part of his storytelling in his artworks. \u201cThe fish represents our constant mulling, the sunflowers represent positivity, toilet systems represent loopholes and escape from the world, dead fish represent the idea of decadence,\u201d says Lama.", "But what\u2019s interesting in Lama\u2019s work is although he jumps from one idea to another in his paintings, because his main intention is latched to the way our mind works, they all come together.

They are not pleasing. Instead, they implore our thoughts on our own frustrations. They are reflections of our reality. His series also emphasises the process of time\u2019s revelation: how it changes our views and teaches us valuable lessons in life; how fatherhood has changed him as a person. These in the paintings are seen in the juxtaposition of tight tall buildings that have limited the view of the open sky, and in the many material objects placed in the paintings.", "Some of his works also suggest how we have been exploiting our environment and contributing to climate change. One particular painting stands out the most, which is titled \u2018Close to extinction\u2019. The painting uses a dark blue hue, with popping colours like red, orange and yellow. In it there is a small boat, while a person swims underwater with a large net, the fish outside the net are dead, while the live ones that have been caught on the net seem to be dying. The painting is striking but in a horrifying way. Lama had also won the National Fine Arts Award for the portrayal in 2017.", "The artist also seems to dwell in the most ordinary realities of life where all humans are no different than the other. Take for instance his work that shows figures taking a dump. Besides showing a person relieving oneself, the work shows, ever so subtly, the idea of this reclusive space into which people go to enjoy their solemness.", "It\u2019s interesting to understand how Lama\u2019s mind works to make meaning of his experiences. Lama immersed in this experience for three years, and perhaps that\u2019s why his work feels pensive.", "The series, however, might take time to register with people, as his works are not as straightforward as paintings usually are. And although his work is powerful, certain things probably would have intensified his storytelling. Given that artists are creating a world in their exhibitions\u2014Lama could have experimented a little with the idea of background music and personal photographs to give more life to his presentation. To give his series a more human flavour, Lama could have benefitted from revealing his own life a bit more, as he already makes bare his personal experience. Lama\u2019s works are beautiful and poetic but fall short of creating an experience. Nevertheless, the exhibition organised by the artist himself is worth your time and pondering.

Others like Keki Adhikari and Priyanka Karki are also regularly interacting with fans on social media. And although social media seems to provide some relief, the larger truth is that the industry has come to a grinding halt. And its future is uncertain.

The CEO of QFX cinemas, Roshan Adiga,", " said they\u2019re set to close until June, which means Nepali films will be stuck in limbo at least until the mid of this year.", "But even before the lockdown began in Kathmandu, things had begun to be wary. As people knew very little about the virus, shooting schedules were disrupted and filmmakers were pushing their release dates. There were confusions about payments, contracts, and pre-selling of overseas rights. And then before anybody could understand anything, the lockdown was announced. Things were brought to an abrupt pause, and we couldn\u2019t do anything but stay home. ", "But what we also need to consider is that Nepali films weren\u2019t doing well even before the virus. Last year alone, only three out of around 55 films were financially successful and only seven broke even. Covid-19 is only another addition to a long list of problems ", " with. Filmmakers have always battled against adversities since the inception of cinema in Nepal. ", "The first Nepali film was produced from Kolkata in 1951. Nepal\u2019s first film came much later from Kathmandu in 1964. And we fell in love with it right away. In 30 quick years, we already had our superstars, chartbusters, and multiple film halls around the country. In the '90s there were around 500 cinema theaters, including Hi-vision halls and video halls. That is without counting many unregistered screening spots that showed films through a VCR. ", "But with the armed political conflict and persistent attacks on theatre owners during the insurgency, hundreds of theatres closed down. Quantity and even quality of Nepali films produced during this time suffered. Director Dipendra Lama, who worked as a film critic then, says, \u201cA lot of films were just ripping off Indian cinema at that time.\u201d The storyline, characters, action sequences, and even the sound design and background scores in the films of that time bear striking resemblance to Hindi films.", "Lama and his contemporary reviewers, including directors like Deepak Rauniyar and Manoj Pandit, were doing their best to discourage the practice through their writing. \u201cReviewers from my generation always pointed out the copy-paste trend, the unoriginality, dependence on technology, and shunned music-video style filmmaking,\u201d Lama adds. ", "Then, when the digital age rolled out, it helped evolve the Nepali cinema. It provided a platform for original stories from young filmmakers. It became easier to create, distribute, and exhibit cinema. Cheaper DSLR cameras and home-assembled editing suits encouraged a new batch of filmmakers. ", "This new wave gave us directors like Nischal Basnet, Rambabu Gurung, Prashant Rasaily, and Deepak Rauniyar, all of whom had a distinct style of presentation and storytelling. Abinash Bikram Shah, a screenwriter who has worked closely with many of these filmmakers, says, \u201cTechnology and access to world cinema made it easier for young Nepali makers to express themselves through cinema. This in-turn gave us recognition in the international festival scene.\u201d", "Along with the filmmakers, Nepali audiences too were also rediscovering Nepali cinema, and films ran to packed theatres. Then, came the 2015 earthquakes that put the industry at a standstill for almost four months. The films that were released after the standstill had better storytelling and were commercially successful. ", "Makers like Dipendra K Khanal, Deepak Raj Giri with Deepa Shree Niraula, and Khagendra Lamicchane told local stories in their genre of comfort. Nepali filmmakers enjoyed international exposure in notable festivals too. Feature-length films of Min Bham and Deepak Rauniyar, and short films from Pooja Gurung with Bibhusan Basnet, Rajan Khatet, and Ankit Poudel garnered accolades around the world. Major film labs and notable international festivals began noticing Nepali films and investing in our stories.

The Second World War gave us Italian Neo-Realism and French New Wave Cinemas,\u201d he says. These waves transformed cinema across the globe, and he hopes for something similar now. ", "Deepak Rauniyar believes online screening and virtual cinema might be the new norm. He is optimistic of newer technology coming into the forefront. His film \u2018White Sun\u2019 is available on Amazon prime, and he hopes for other Nepali films to follow suit. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of online streaming platforms coming up in South Asia, and they\u2019re interested in Nepali cinema for their catalog,\u201d says Rauniyar. ", "Nepal too has its own streaming services that seem to be doing well for themselves, like iflix, Video Pasal, and Dish Home. More such streaming services are slated for launch in the near future. \u201cAfter the pandemic, traditional establishments like cinema halls might collapse entirely, and online platforms might not be enough for filmmakers to survive on,\u201d says Rauniyar. ", "However, for the industry to survive, private investments will not be enough to make the industry stable. Therefore the need for the hour is government intervention. Rauniyar says that in New York, the government has \u201cannounced stimulus packages for small and larger companies working in cinema.\u201d He says that these desperate times call for viable mechanisms to help sustain the cinema industry. Some Nepali filmmakers, distributors, and exhibitors from the Nepal Motion Pictures Association agree with Rauniyar. To bring that into effect, they submitted a ", " recently. The memorandum broadly requests for a care package to save Nepali cinema from economic devastation.", "But the Nepali government has notoriously stayed away from any sort of investment in Nepali cinema. The closest the government has come to working with the industry was when Visit Nepal 2020 had a programme that promoted \u2018Nepal as a film destination\u2019. While the programme might have helped Nepal appear on the global map as a tourist spot, there\u2019s nothing for the local cinema industry. ", "The next most viable alternative for cinema then is international funding but that too will require government assistance. International funding and co-production opportunities with filmmakers from foreign countries require the state to be involved at the policy level. A co-production agreement usually requires both countries agreeing on certain prerequisites. \u201cFilmmakers today need the state\u2019s support, participation, and investment,\" Rauniyar says. ", "We also need government organisations like the Film Development Board to learn from international examples. The countries that boast of a strong film culture\u2014Korea, India, Iran, and lately the Philippines\u2014all enjoy a very strong support from their respective governments. For example, in India, the National Film Development Corporation organises film markets and supports independent films. ", "For now, no one really knows how this pandemic will turn out. But it\u2019s in our best interest if we can plan ahead our route to normalcy. Although there are many other areas that require urgent attention, cinema and art will be important in helping us ease into normalcy. Cinema until now has survived two global wars, numerous political transitions, and economic devastations. Nepali cinema can even add natural calamities to that list.

Nagarkoti\u2019s liberal use of English words in his Nepali language novels, short stories and plays has often been criticised by language purists. Bathtub is not Nagarkoti\u2019s response to them; in fact, it is almost as if he is pushing them further, daring them to censure him more.

His scribe Anindra once fell in love with a\u00a0poet who wanted to bind his manuscript with her hair, so she cut it all off and gave it to him. As Nisabdha dictates his novel to Anindra, the primary character, the serial killer, comes to life, demanding a change in his fate. What follows is an at-times hilarious, at-times emotional existential struggle between creator and created, fate and free will, theft and inspiration.\u00a0", "Deftly directed by Ghimire Yubaraj, the play treads familiar Nagarkoti grounds, where the bizarre and surreal recur with alarming regularity. No one seems to bat an eye that the fictional serial killer has come to life and is threatening his creator with a gun. Anindra frequently transitions between dream and reality while Nisabdha receives a phone call from death\u2019s personal secretary as if it were just another banality.

One phrase, too, keeps recurring\u2014black coffee khane ko mann pani black huncha (black are the hearts of those who drink black coffee). When Nisabdha attempts to substitute the Nepali word \u2018kalo\u2019 for black, the serial killer interjects, saying that\u2019s not what he said\u2014he used the word black, not kalo. This attraction to the nuances of language is evident in the names of the characters themselves, Nisabdha, meaning wordless, and Anindra, meaning sleepless.", "The play itself is a delight to watch, artfully transitioning from comedy to tragedy. The three actors are excellent. Bhushita Vasistha as Anindra is quixotic and starry-eyed, a perfect vehicle for the character. Brazesh as the serial killer is both brazen and wistful in his attempt to change the arc of his character. But the star of the show is Neer Shah as Nisabdha Shumsher Rana. The veteran actor-director is brilliant with his comedic timing and his eventual turn towards the tragic. All three actors play their roles with aplomb, amid a set that is creatively Spartan with the barest of minimums. Particularly clever is Anindra cascading a handful of letter tiles from her hands as an analogue for typing.\u00a0", "The hour and fifteen minutes of Bathtub go by in a flash of the serial killer\u2019s crimson cape. The play moves swiftly, as Anindra and Nisabdha bicker over fictional nuances and the serial killer demands that they celebrate his birthday. Bathtub is playful and never takes itself quite too seriously. Even though the final act of the play gets a little too serious a little too fast, it is a believable turn. The audience goes from uproarious laughter to stunned silence in a matter of minutes but it\u2019s a fair gambit. Unlike a lot of contemporary plays, Bathtub, like most of Nagarkoti\u2019s work, is no social realistic drama.

And the performance is the part of Norwegian artists Elle and Janne Hoem\u2019s visual concert \u2018Territorium\u2019. The artists describe Territorium as a cross-disciplinary performance composed as an intermedial work, that lies at the intersection of a concert, installation, performance and physical theatre.", "The performance is equally bewildering and cryptic like the artists\u2019 description, yet it is remarkable. Back at the theatre, it is dark yet soothing, and most of it does not make sense. But the audience remains in absolute calm and quiet as anticipation fills the air.

More feathers are sprinkled from above the stage that unceremoniously mixes with the ones on the ground. But the way they fall mirrors the movement of sunrays falling through a window. On top of the circle, there is a light, which may be taken as the centre of the universe. Pointing towards the circle are lights that are projected from the ground in three directions\u2014two diagonally and one straight. These lights are all controlled as per the music.", "There are two screens behind the stage that projects different visuals while the performers sing and play music. In the visuals, it seems that Elle is trying to manifest himself as different personalities. The pitch of the music corresponds with the character\u2019s expressions. It is almost like sitting in a chamber that portrays someone else\u2019s mind.", "These combinations of light, music, movements and props are like witnessing abstract art in motion. Light design and new media artist Jan Hustak deserves special mention for the light-music synchronisation. His improvisation of lighting is commendable as he sets the tone and mood quite brilliantly.", "Theatre artist Durga Biswokarma is another delight to watch during the performance\u2014she adds her own flavour to the performances.

He collects, composes, and re-assembles textures, timbres, lingual peculiarities, and melodic surplus, which he says, has given birth to a unique blend of traditional and modern.

Budathoki\u2019s Nepali version is a loyal adaption of the original, following the same narrative of showcasing how people have misplaced ideas when it comes to courtship. Rather than for love or partnership, people are drawn towards the idea of marriage to improve their financial status or social standing. Although Chekov wrote the play two centuries ago, this idea of marriage is still relevant in Nepali society.", "But in their bid to stay loyal to the original play, the director kept the Russian names of the characters rather than translating them to Nepali monikers\u2014something typically done to help the audience relate to the characters. The director\u2019s choice to keep the Russian names is debatable, given the actors have done everything to bring life to Chekov\u2019s characters.

The fact that they seemed like an actual couple fighting was what makes the actors\u2019 commitment more palpable.

The director definitely had a line up of deft actors, but in the end, the production let him and the actors down. The set design, including the lighting, is mediocre at best. The light engineer seems to have tried to set the tone, but he seems to lack both experience and equipment. Same is the case with sound\u2014it seems disjointed as well as out of sync with the actors at times.", "The wider team, however, did put in a lot of effort and hard work. This can be exemplified by the props, the most notable being the use of masks. They effortlessly signified the two-faced nature of the characters, adding depth to the possibilities of how each protagonist can act or react in certain situations.

The men are wearing suits like they\u2019re attending a wedding while Poudel, who says she came from the fields, doesn\u2019t look like it at all.", "The length of the play also does not seem to be in its favour. Some scenes between Poudel and Bohora could have been a bit shorter, or other topics could have been incorporated, to make it a bit relevant to the Nepali context.", "Overall, the play is entertaining. It makes you laugh, it makes you emotional, and it leaves you wondering if marriage is worth it at all. The flaws of the play can be ignored, as the theatre is quite new, but only with hope it improves in the future.

And by breaking down the book into two volumes\u2014Foreign Policy and Diplomacy\u2014the writer has taken a bold step, in the sense that he has attempted a dangerous, if not impossible, task of breaking the realm of foreign affairs into two seemingly water-tight compartments of foreign policy and diplomacy. But Acharya pulls it off, by combining his envious record of academic and governmental experience, to put together this book.

Yet the novel falls short of its noble intentions, with insufficient research and fact-checking. For such an emotional telling, the writing is quite mediocre, bordering on the mundane at times. There is out-of-place romanticising, incongruous philosophising, and unadorned sentences that do not do justice to the emotional saga.

Excerpts:", "I was a studious pupil, and reading was always part of my childhood. When you grow up in a village, that too in the 1960s, there isn\u2019t much to do other than read. There was no television, the short wave of radio was difficult to receive. So, the only way to pass time was to read books. Books were my best friend. ", "After the 1950s, there was also a wave of libraries being built, so in the border areas there were a lot of libraries, which made it easier for children like us to access books. We could always walk to the border town and get books, and they were quite affordable. However, they were mostly Hindi books, so I came to English books much later. ", "I remember in the village people used to stage dramas of Ram Leela, and it occured to me that I should read the book. And I remember enjoying reading it. And it was around that time that I realised reading was fun, which caught on more as I grew up. ", "In my time, if you were good in studies, there were two options for you\u2014either medicine or engineering. So, I went with engineering. But in college, I also started writing and discovered that I love writing. But I never wrote as a hardcore journalist, I started as a columnist and I still remain one.

Studying engineering made me more focussed on the process, not just the result. ", "I am a daily newspaper reader. I buy at least seven newspapers on average, and on the web, I regularly check five portals, two from India, one each from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. So you could say I read about 10 to 15 newspapers a day. I also read a lot of books. If you are to write about current events it is necessary to read about many perspectives and experiences, especially the past. It is very difficult to analyse current events by just reading about current events. ", "I don\u2019t have a routine that I follow strictly. I spend my morning reading newspapers, basically scanning them.

Madhesh is absent from the mainstream discussion mainly because it has never been part of the Nepali imagination; it is an outside entity for most people and we don\u2019t talk about the outside. We even talk about the marginalised and almost never about the externalised. But this has to change. Nepal has to think about this section of its people, a third of its population.

The market also only wants one language, because it\u2019s easier for the advertising world, to communicate with the consumer with just one language. ", "It's only in a cultural society that we talk about multiple languages, which people think are more important than the language of the state or the market. The challenge for the government then is how to marry these two diverse expectations. And that I think, in a country like ours, is still manageable if we adapt multiple languages and accept them in governance. This might get a little complicated for the government but if you acknowledge the many languages people use, they will share a loyalty with the government\u2014and that ownership will become an impetus for the government, making governance easier.", "The reason indigenous readership is decreasing is because our language is not related to the marketplace or employment opportunity.

There\u2019s no invocation of the muses, no supernatural elements, and no heroic valour. There are, however, characters that keep coming and going: Devi and Mukti.

Two idealists, they voice their concerns frankly, and the poet agrees with whatever they have to say.", "The epic begins with the introductory canto With the World Outside, where the poet rises out of uncertainty and tries to trace his own identity. Like a postmodern human, he rejects the notion of the centre. He is always moving, always shifting. And out of his move, his never-ending fluidity, he both decentres and recentres the logos\u2014the ultimate truth.

And to distinguish animalism from humanism, Singh calls for a humanistic mindset and education.", "Singh was born in 1877 as a prince of the ancient kingdom of Bajhang, located in the north-west of modern Nepal. He was well-educated and married to Khageshwori Devi, the daughter of prime minister Chandra Shumsher JB Rana. He served as political advisor to the prime minister\u2019s advisory board. He was a linguist and journalist, wrote textbooks for schools and also wrote the first Nepali grammar book. He started the first newspaper of Nepal, Gorkhapatra. He also established and financed a number of schools in far western parts of Nepal, and in Kathmandu, at a time when the Rana regime was controlling the education system.", "Singh was among the first thinkers of modern Nepal. He could be compared to the likes of contemporaries like the philosopher Antonio Gramsci, as Singh fits Gramsci\u2019s description of the \u2018organic intellectual\u2019, who with a humanistic mindset is intimately involved in public issues. He was an extraordinary educationalist of his time. Exactly 75 years after the publication of Singh\u2019s ", " (1928), Edward Said\u2019s ", " (2004) was published. And there are unique similarities between the ideas of the two scholars on humanistic education. I am not making a comparison between the two books. My aim here is to highlight the need for humanistic education based on their related ideas. Singh\u2019s book ", " (reprinted 2019) is a collection of the three volumes published earlier, and I will focus only on the chapter dealing with humanist education. ", "On the educational systems of the classic-era South Asia, Singh writes that \u201ceducation was not a means of lively-hood, but was perused only for the sake of knowledge. This needed a particular attitude and a special mentality; and only those that were endowed with them undertook the risk and the expenses involved in the journey to, and the stay in, the centres of higher cultures.\u201d Singh also writes that education was not widespread during his time. Rich private individuals financed the educational centres and selected students were not charged fees. The selected students were individuals with specific attitudes and financial capacities. ", "Singh also details that the local village schools in his time taught basic reading, writing and mathematics to selected students. In this way, the division of the caste system prevailed throughout the history of the country, and across much of South Asia. Singh\u2019s concern for humanistic education and search for the cure of human troubles and miseries continues to date. ", "Singh gives equal value to studies of science and social science. He says that modern education only \u201cattempts to fit a man for this world and equip him with the necessary knowledge and means for the battle of life\u2026 modern education limits one\u2019s ideal of life here and its relations with the surroundings, immediate and present.\u201d In this way modern education does not take the wider issues into account, including the interest of future generations. Classic and modern educational systems have failed to give humanistic knowledge, and the continuation of racism and mutual hostility towards people of different colour, language, nationality and ethnic origin are harsh evidence of that. Singh says the problem lies with the utilitarian approach to education and lack of environment where humanism becomes a primary educational objective. ", "The idea of humanism has different connotations. For some people, the idea is a secular alternative to religions. For others, humanism is natural, scientific and democratic concerns outside religions. It is a common concern that humanism as a discourse is under threat, essentially because of a complex set of crisis of the survival of the human civilisation. The threat has arisen, primarily because of the lack of emphasis on the true goal of humanistic education. This is the conclusion made by Singh.", "A common theme that appears in the writings of Singh and Said is the rejection of artificial divide between people, which is the common discourse of many modern liberal intellectuals. The ignorance of oneness as human is imperfect knowledge, Singh says, considering it meaningless, mercilessly violational and the main cause of human miseries; \u201cas a result of imperfect knowledge, man sees no unity in others. He sees in them only division and diversity...\u201d ", "Said\u2019s idea of humanistic education resembles Singh\u2019s humanistic oneness. Said explains that \u201cit is more rewarding\u2014and more difficult\u2014to think concretely and sympathetically, contrapunctually, about others than only about \u2018us\u2019. But this also means not trying to rule others, not trying to classify them or put them in hierarchies, above all, not constantly reiterating how \u2018our\u2019 culture or country is number one or not number one, for that matter.\u201d ", "Singh and Said are reiterating the quest for knowledge and belief in intellectual truth. Intellectuals are often lonely individuals, writing often behind bars (example, Gramsci) or in exile (Singh and Said lived and died in exile) but they were organic intellectuals and public intellectuals nonetheless. ", "Both Singh and Said believed not just in self-knowledge but also in self-critic. For Said, a public intellectual is not necessarily an expert but an amateur who goes beyond his area of knowledge and explores ideas and takes a stand against the power based on intellectual truth. Singh too believed that self-knowledge is unattainable without an equal degree of self-criticism, or the awareness that comes from studying and experiencing other people\u2019s traditions, and ideas.

His eyes meet a distant view as he talks about his love for writing, as though he has never given these matters much thought before. Things just unravelled because he kept following his heart, he says. And all he knew when he started writing was that he loved it in an indelible way. \u201cMy passion for writing never died, even when I immersed myself in the administration and academic teachings of police training,\u201d he says. ", "Shah is now a retired policeman, a former Deputy Inspector General of Police, and has ample time for himself, time he wants to invest in writing a novel. He has so far published seven anthologies and won the Madan Puraskar for his book, Chapamarko Choro. He is known for his realistic writings that don\u2019t sway readers with fluff. His stories bring them closer to the social realities of diverse individuals and real-life incidents.", "In an interview with the Post\u2019s ", ", Shah talks about his love for writing and the need for people to realise the importance of one\u2019s mother tongue.\u00a0", "I was a studious pupil and my father too was an avid reader, and that is probably why I loved reading and writing. In school, I also used to participate in many literature programmes. My teacher Dhanan Jaya Timilsena too encouraged me a lot to write. He used to say, \u201cYou have a flair of a writer; you should become one.\u201d So, eventually, I started dreaming of writing, but then my father wanted me to become a doctor, and so I went to study science at Amrit Campus. ", "After I finished my BSc, I joined the police force, as my father was a policeman too. It seemed like the right option for me at the time, as I didn\u2019t use to write much then. However, I was still passionate about writing, so I made sure that I had time for it. And because for the first 15 years, I was more invested in instructing and teaching in the Police Academy, whenever I would have time, I would commit myself to writing stories. ", "And I think my profession gave me more opportunities to explore diverse contexts in stories. It made me accessible to our Nepali stories, gave me a stance to understand the situation in different perspectives. My work connected me with people and their problems and struggles. As a policeman, you become a listener of the people\u2014they tell you their problems, and you try to solve their issues at hand you see. And every day, you would come across several issues, from something ordinary to matters of justice. Many incidences have also given me plot lines to explore in my stories. ", "A novel requires a lot of time. It demands you to immerse yourself in the experience. It requires more research and depth. And I didn\u2019t have such a luxury; I had to divide my time to be able to commit to writing. But I also felt, as a writer, I could do more justice with my stories in short anthologies. It was just enough to express what I wanted to. But I hope to write novels too, now that I have a reasonable amount of time for myself. ", "History is written by those in power, but if you read fiction, you will be able to see the diverse realities of life. Stories present themselves in a context that tells of the surroundings that sometimes history books fail to address. For example, my book Chapamarko Choro was able to provide insight into three sides in the armed conflict. One, of the armies, the other of the Maoists and third, of the people whose lives were set in the middle of the dispute between the state and the Maoists. I think literature can mirror our society without any fear of authority or bias. Writers are honest to their stories, and they don\u2019t calculate the impression of their storytelling. They tell a story, presenting facts for what they are, providing both a zooming lens to a situation and an eagle eye view to a context. Literature is more inclusive than history books.", "My characters and my stories are not imaginary; they are stories of people I have met. Instead I would say they are impressions left on me by incidents that I witnessed or experienced. ", "Usually, I work on the framework of my plot in my head before writing it down. And when I am confident of my structure, I sit down to write. But while writing, sometimes stories take a different turn. But I can actually write anywhere, I don\u2019t really need to get away from the crowd to write. ", "But, I also think writing is difficult when you are not clear about the set up of your story. So, I usually don\u2019t write when I am not clear about my storyline. I take my time to think about my characters and my endings. And when I am done, I usually ask my wife to read it. She is a critical reader and gives me honest feedback. ", "Earlier I didn\u2019t work on drafts. My first draft used to be my final one. But I think it changed when I read Samrat Upadhyay\u2019s Arresting God in Kathmandu. In his preface, he mentioned how he re-worked on his draft because of his editor. These days, I go through my drafts multiple times, but I don\u2019t make drastic changes to my drafts. I like them raw. ", "But here in Nepal, the idea of editing and drafting is still new to writers. In other countries, a work of writing is a more involved process, which demands the critical eye of publishers and editors as well. In Nepal, we haven\u2019t been able to give that sort of attention to writing. Perhaps, because we still don\u2019t have enough competent and skilled people in leadership who can scrutinise a writer\u2019s work.", "I think there are two reasons for the decreasing readership. One is that the works that are coming out are not good enough to make people feel that Nepali works are significant. And the other is this pervasive idea that our literature is not as good as western literature.", "And I think this idea is deeply rooted in us because of how we treat our language. In schools, the curriculum and reading habit emphasises more on English fiction and non-fiction works. And parents are proud when their children are fluent in English and lacking in the Nepali language. This encourages the idea that works in the Nepali language are dispensable, and so people are not even introduced to the great works of Nepali literature that we have. ", "But I think with time people will realise the significance of our language and how it is tied to our individuality and uniqueness. There was a time when people didn\u2019t want to be identified with their castes, the Dalits used to write themselves as Nepalis, the Magars as Thapas. But today people feel proud to identify themselves as a Gurung or a Newar or a Thakali. And I think slowly, this movement will help people to realise the importance of our language. ", "Language creates a sense of belonging and learning English doesn\u2019t mean you have to forget your mother tongue. People should understand the more we can promote our various languages through works of literature and research, the more we will be able to retain our uniqueness and individuality.

For over a decade now, the city resplendent with heritage and culture has hosted the JLF. As Festival Director, Gokhale fully exploits her insider information and secrets, bringing to attention minute details and carving out unpredictable-seeming characters. The best part is that she sees through all the vainglorious pomposity that often surrounds creators, and does not shy away from making fun of them\u2014or even the festival itself. ", "\u201cWhat is the point, what is the purpose, of so many books being written? The sheer bulk of it\u2014the weight of the output, of content creation and self-expression in the days of digital democracy, of all-encompassing platforms\u2014devalues thought, devalues literature,\u201d says a Nobel laureate giving a speech at the fest.

How sneakily this tussle between the \u2018classic\u2019 and \u2018contemporary\u2019 has been woven into the novel. ", "Peacocks and peahens and monkeys, masala chai scooped out of a burnished copper pot, people chatting excitedly in Hindi and English and Spanish\u2014and Nepali: the festival comes alive in the pages and the reader becomes an eager participant. Despite several works in fiction and non-fiction, some with great beauty and sensitivities, Gokhale is a relatively underrated writer, and she deserves credit for her effortless style and control over words. Paradoxical as it might sound, there is an artless finesse in her writing that is quite unique, an indecipherable quality of being readable even in its most intricately literary form. The novel has an engrossing start, then there are tantalising snippets, real-life incidents and a clash of vanities that quite simulate the buzz and drama that takes place every year at the festival. ", "And yet, with all its promises, Jaipur Journals is a sad and lonely work, a work layered with contempt and spite, which somehow does not suit the overall ambience. With Rabindranath Tagore addressed as \u201cThat Bengali!\u201d, the painstaking use of \u2018woke\u2019 to appear hip, the condescension towards writing and writers in general, a constant mocking of the creative and publishing process\u2026 there is little to keep you sympathetic or anchored towards the festival, the foundation of the entire book. That the narrator has arguments with the contemporary literary scenario, that she snaps at the existing system is understandable, and this is perhaps the effect that the novel sets out to generate. To provoke and incense the reader, to acquaint them with the fake veneer that coats their favourite authors and revered books.", "But this acerbic tone that permeates the novel is not quite enjoyable, and takes us far away from the original setting. It does not translate to a biting or intelligent satire. There are other challenges, too: the novel reinforces the stereotype of the matronly closet writer; of the sparkling socialite and her rampant infidelity, of the evocative and forgiving Muslim orator. There are some true characters, and some hasty caricatures. A conversation between two cousins on sexualities and its hidden politics, claiming to be \u2018highly entertaining\u2019, is distinctly unfunny and unnecessary. And after introducing some interesting characters and an array of possibly riveting situations, the plot just sort of fizzles off, leaving us with a half-hearted climax.

My field research area was Temal, Kavrepalanchok.", "Initially, I was engaged in the mixed programme. But, as an anthropologist, I started to discover that there were very different types of people living together like the Magi, Tamang, and Brahmin. And so, I was interested in finding out about the Tamangs. ", "I learnt the language in 1978, before coming; first in the French School of Oriental Studies, and second, with the Tamang people. When I came in 1980, I could speak in Nepali, but when I went to Kavrepalanchok, the place where I was conducting my research, I realised what I learnt was not the Nepali language that people used there. Most of the people were Tamang, and they spoke in the Tamang language, a Tibeto-Burman language which was an unwritten language at the time. So, it added to the difficulty to adapt. ", "At the time, an irrigation project had just reached the area, and it was creating conflict between caste groups. They were discussing where to put the water tank. This was during the Panchayat period, and it was interesting to understand how people were clinging to a political party, what their sense of politics was and what it meant for them. Many Tamang people were involved in trekking, and that was taking them everywhere in Nepal. But the Tamang people also had a different idea of Nepal; they called Kathmandu ", ", which means Nepal in the Tamang language. For me, that was interesting because we were already in Nepal, and I wanted to understand what made them see things that way.", "What I liked was that people shared everything, and were able to accept a foreigner with great heart and interest. Their conflicts were limited to the use of water at the village spring. For example, the Brahmins and the Tamangs would take turns to use the spring water. Life was very simple although it was very hard. ", "Initially, I studied philosophy, Latin, Greek, science and literature in France. And then I turned to ethnology in the 70s; it was just after the civil unrest of May \u201868. In 1968 we had a revolution that arose through questions related to the changing and transforming of times and mores. There were many demonstrations, and I was starting to get interested in ethnology. A new department had just begun in science universities.

I heard about Tibet from my grandfather because he was friends with Alexandra David-N\u00e9el, one of the first women who were able to enter the city of Lhasa in 1905. I was also interested in Nepal because of mountaineering, something I did in the Alps and later in Lhotse and Kanchenjunga in the 80s.", " ", "In philosophy, we study philosophical systems, ideas, history of concepts. Initially, anthropology was for me a part of the philosophical system of Kant (a german philosopher). But I wanted to experience non-western societies.

Everything was transparent and we could understand their infrastructure easily; houses were made with earth and wood; complex rituals presided over the construction.", "As an anthropologist, I tried to document how they were organising their world or how they explained the ways they were creating their world. I was also very interested in learning about their religion, and I began to understand locally the differences they made between Hinduism and Buddhism. The Magars were mainly Hindus and Tamangs Buddhists. But society was complex, especially the Tamangs: they had Tibetan script, but they spoke in Tamang language, and I wanted to find out about the interconnection between them.

Discomfitingly close to life in Bangladesh, and indeed, the whole of South Asia and beyond. The plight of the downtrodden, the subaltern, the deliberately ostracised. In his second work of fiction, and the first anthology of stories, Bangladeshi-American writer ", " has put these characters, so conveniently relegated to the margins of the society, at the very centre of his plots.

The bitter truth of money, the way it mends and sours friendships.

", "The specialty of the stories, that of centralising the margin, is clearly a winner. It adds a humane, gritty yet soft side to the people who many of us take for granted each day. Zaman is sensitive in his treatment of these characters, and attempts to view the world from their perspective. Unlike other stories, the poor or the disadvantaged do not merely ache. They speak out, they protest, they dream and philosophise. ", "But the author seems too eager to establish his characters as the overlooked \u201cgood\u201d in this world. Almost every story has an insertion of a \u201cmoral\u201d or \u201cpoetic\u201d line, where the rich are corrupt and godless, while the downtrodden are pure of heart and deserve all our sympathies. This might be an unconscious bias, but it definitely is overdone in the stories, with the rich and their depravities; the poor and their suffering.", "And for stories that seem to make an effort to delve into the heart and soul of Bangladesh, the setting is not rendered convincingly enough. There are relatable portrayals of the country here and there, but the stories are unable to bring out the true essence of a people and its culture, just making do with perfunctory and superficial descriptions.

{"title": "The Indian Nexus", "content": ["\u201cThe great nations have always acted like gangsters, and the small nations like prostitutes.\u201d This highly political quote doesn't come from a political scientist or politician but from a legendary Hollywood film director, Stanley Kubrick. This rather blunt observation\u2014emanated more from experience than theory\u2014reflects perhaps the truest account of the generic trait of relationships between large and small countries. Of course, there are several seminal theories related to the variation of policy behaviour of the larger and smaller nation-states (see for example, the article by Maurice A. East, 1973, Size ", ", World Politics, Vol. 25, No. 4), but the fate of smaller states barely seems to have altered for centuries despite the rise of many facets of equality narratives in global diplomacy. The predicament of the smaller ones appears more pronounced when they are adjacent to relatively very powerful neighbours.", "Journalist and editor Sudheer Sharma's latest book, ", " (2019), only reinforces Kubrick's almost six decade old epitaph. The book alludes that the main vantage point for all observations contained in the book effectively is New Delhi, not Kathmandu. And except from limited alliterative aesthetics, one wonders why the title is \u2018The Nepal Nexus\u2019 as opposed to \u2018The Indian Nexus', as it would have been a better suited title. The author baptises it as the book of 'politics and geopolitics' and acknowledges that the English edition is an outcome of 'modified, updated and translated' version of his earlier book in Nepali, the Prayogshala (2013), but how much so is debatable.", "The work is undoubtedly an accomplished product of the author's hard work and is a very systematic presentation of researched material. He must be praised for at least three distinct characteristics of the exposition. First is the boldness and courage with which Sharma has brought out information, particularly on Nepal-related activities, engagements and movements of India's international intelligence agency Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) officials. The book in many instances has evidenced and established many incessant hearsays surrounding the RAW's influence, meddling and/or micromanagement into Nepal's internal politics whereas in many other cases, shown how futile RAW's own conclusions and strategies have proven to be.", "Second, the book has presented facts with verifiable authenticity since, barring a few exceptions, the actors, characters and interviewees of the author are still active in their respective fields. Also, this phenomenon is vindicated by the fact that during the last seven years since the publication of Prayogshala, not even a single Nepali politician, security forces and/or RAW operatives came out to refute the claims made regarding their role as mentioned in the book. The detailed facts of the incidents and published references presented with due credit make the work not only a collection of placid journalistic reportages but also a valuable academic product that is in compliance with the global tradition of knowledge creation.", "Third, a systematic chronology of political events of the last three decades in Nepal with exact dates, locations and parties involved makes the book an important and citable historical document. It has a lot of flesh for those willing, specifically, to understand origin, culmination and effective dissolution of Nepal's Maoist insurgency, counter-insurgency measures adopted by the governments of different political ideologies, the peace process that followed and their mainly political fallouts (as the book is not directly focused on social, economic and other ramifications of the insurgency and ensuing machinations).", "As the title of the book suggests, it dwells on the chessboard like moves and strategies of four major political players in Nepal then: the monarchy under two different Kings, Birendra and his brother Gyanendra, the Maoists in rebellion, RAW and mainstream parliamentary party, Nepali Congress in particular. The book exposes a number of antithetic developments during the period. King Birendra's refusal to allow the mobilisation of Nepali army to crush the Maoists despite recommendation of elected Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala for the same and then constantly circulating hypothesis of impending coup d'\u00e9tat allegedly contemplated by the king help explain why the democracy could not take roots under the constitutional monarchy.", "In later years of insurgency, as revealed by the book, the Maoists and monarchy worked to come together and strategise to send the leaders of parliamentary parties behind the bars (page 117). Such an industry for collusion between two ideological extremes unmasks both; the republican hypocrisy of the Maoists leaders and the democratic dogma of the monarchy. Similarly, India's abandonment of two-pillar policy of supporting the constitutional monarchy and multi-party democracy in apparent favour to Maoist agenda and paradigm shifts of the latter from 'expansionist India to ally in making Nepal a republic' bring sheer opportunistic politics ", " ideology to the fore. The book\u2014with details of dozens of encounters of high-ranking RAW officials with Maoist supremo Puspa Kamal Dahal and a few others\u2014unveils not only close contacts between the two but also the treacheries, tactics and tantrums Maoists customised after each of these crucial meetings. In addition, the book also validates the RAW's keen interest and visible involvement in shaping and extending the Madhes movements of 2008 and 2015.", "Although, the author at the very outset claims that the book is an updated version of the Prayogshala, the rigor and depth in coverage and demystification of the events that unfolded after Nepal promulgated the 2015 constitution seems lacking. One of rationale of the new edition of the book beyond catering the same Prayogshala content to the English readers is the update of the developments that took place after the publication of the Nepali version. Chapters 23 to 27 touch upon this critical period, but the depth and breadth of research and inferences seem little diluted compared to the original version. The dynamics of role and expectation of Indian establishment, specifically RAW, after six years of Bharatiya Janata Party in power in Delhi, and strategic rise of Chinese influence in Nepali politics undoubtedly deserved more detailed treatment which is clearly only suboptimal.", "Sharma's somewhat sweeping conclusion that India is hardly willing to change and maintains the tendency 'to indulge in one experiment after another in Nepal, at the heart of which lies its desire to have a state of 'controlled instability', where no single force is decisive, so that Nepal's dependence on its neighbour persists and it can guide the country where it sees fit' (page 471). This 'experimentation' perhaps is unlikely to last very long as rapidly changing geopolitics of the region is making a transformation from 'controlled' to 'competitive' a new imperative even for India."], "author": "Achyut Wagle", "article_published_date": "", "article_updated_date": "Updated at : April 18, 2020 08:38 "},

However, various efforts have been made, and translators, especially poets, seem to have achieved what poet Octavio Paz called \u201csimilar results.\u201d ", "is an example of one such \u201csimilar result.\u201d Readers looking for a comprehensive anthology of Nepali poems in translation can pick up Haris Adhikari\u2019s latest foray into translating poetry", "and peruse the 64 poems in English. The anthology encompasses poets of three different generations, and thus provides a confluence of multiple contemporary poetic voices of proto-modernists to post-modernist poets. This heteroglossia results in an anthology that is meant to be not just read, but savoured.", "In his lengthy, seminal translator\u2019s note, Adhikari writes that \u201ctranslation is more an art than a science.\u201d To translate the essence of one language into another, the translator should have some essential skills in his arsenal. Knowing how the grammar and syntax of the target language functions, learning the effect of proper punctuation, and deciding the purpose of choosing a certain line length over countless other choices are all ", "What culminates thereafter is ", "\u2014or perhaps the heart\u2014of translation. ", "The 64 poems in this anthology show the best of Nepali writings. From the works of prominent poets like Dinesh Adhikari, Shailendra Sakar, and Tulasi Diwas to the writings of emerging poets like Anil Nembang, Nabin Pyassi, and Nirvik Jung Rayamajhee, the collection showcases the works of Nepali poets for the last fifty years. Many of these poems search for roots albeit with some hidden political edginess. Some of them deal with love and lust, often by employing unusually fresh imagery. ", "Many critics hold the view that only poets should translate poetry. The reason is all too obvious. And Adhikari has played the game well, breaking rules at times, while inventing his own constraints sometimes. His major strength is that the translated poems are equally ", "Readers do not feel like they\u2019re reading prosaic pieces, and the desire to go back to the original works springs only once in a while. The translated verses are self-contained; they suffice poetically and otherwise.", "Here are some memorable sections from the book. The closing stanza of Hangyug Agyat\u2019s ", " employs the conceit of dust elegantly. \u201cDust is all-pervasive in my heart. / I will have to live my life with it\u201d is the poet\u2019s philosophic declaration in this metapoem. I was also enchanted with a phrase from Suman Pokhrel\u2019s ", ": \u201cthe wreckage of broken time.\u201d Also, the ending of Mukul Dahal\u2019s ", "is so very perfect. As such, the anthology has its moments of brilliance. ", "The major quibble about this work of translation is the overuse of sentence inversion. Inversions, though used for emphasising the meaning of the sentence by foregrounding the predicate or the verb, is an archaic poetic tool. A hundred years ago when everyone was writing in meter and rhyme, the inversion would help the poets get the perfect meter. However, this practice is almost obsolete. Take, for instance, the closing stanza of Anmol Kandel\u2019s ", ": \u201cAfter reaching / Right in front of you / Was my race done.\u201d The stress goes on to the word \u201cwas\u201d rather than \u201cmy race,\u201d giving it a feel of Victorian impulse.", "Also, some readers consider capitalising the beginning of every new line throughout the poem a traditional practice, but this is still debatable. Modern poets generally prefer sentence case; whereas the experimental post-modern ones may go on to the extent of eschewing capitalisation and punctuation altogether. For the latter, the way words appear on the page, sprawling with flowing white spaces, is what makes poetry different from prose. Since we have the works of mostly modern Nepali poets, we can argue on the graphology or the lineation of the poems. ", "The translator has, however, attempted experimenting with Hem Pravas\u2019s ", "by playing with the spaces and letter cases. The result is quite amusing, leaving readers wondering. Also, Raj Manglak\u2019s ", "is a delightful concrete poem\u2014the first one I\u2019ve ever seen in Nepali poetry. What readers of Nepali poetry need is the experimental flair coupled with local everyday subjectivity, not just on the level of content but also the way poems appear on the page. Sadly, whatever Nepali poets have been writing is still reminiscent of Bhupi Sherchan or Ishwor Ballav\u2019s works. ", "Another bitter-sweet aspect of this anthology is the use of non-standard Nepali English sparingly across some poems. This might amuse some readers, but the sceptical ones may easily question the intention. Yet, some stanzas suffer by being cluttered and clunky. Let\u2019s take this section: \u201cSort of similar / We are / Returned together, / Like there\u2019s no other person hungry.\u201d This part, along with some other sections from the same poem, suffers from the same fate of being heavy-handed. ", "If one can overlook the pardonable mistakes like \u201cvision in their eyes,\u201d \u201cchanting with their lips,\u201d \u201clittle kids,\u201d \u201ca humming hunter with a gun,\u201d \u201cphilosopher man,\u201d and the remnants of legal language in \u201chereafter,\u201d \u201cherein\u201d or \u201cwhereon\u201d as well the occasional \u201cO yea!\u201d or \u201c\u2018cause,\u201d punctuating the formal tone of the poem, the anthology is a pleasant read. ", "Overall, ", "is quite an accomplishment when it comes to Nepali poetry in translation. Since the translator himself is a distinguished poet, he has taken great care of not just passing the meaning into another language but giving the final product its much-deserved rhythm, cadence and life.
